      "text": "By Mike Carnahan / Published: October 5, 2016 Article Tools – + Share This Blue Mountain’s Brittney Dunleavy, left, and Pottsville’s Megan Dalton battle for control of the ball during Tuesday’s Schuylkill League Division I match. Pottsville’s Carly Hoak, left, and Blue Mountain’s Jacey Miller battle for possession during Tuesday’s Schuylkill League Division I girls’ soccer clash at the Eagles’ Nest. Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link \nORWIGSBURG — The Blue Mountain girls’ soccer team cleared another hurdle in its quest for another Schuylkill League title. \nOlivia Benner had two assists to lead a crisp passing attack by the Eagles, while Blue Mountain’s defense was stout in a 3-1 victory over rival Pottsville in a Division I contest Tuesday night at the Eagles’ Nest. \nThe Eagles (10-4, 8-1 D-I) officially clinched a league playoff spot with their win Tuesday, their seventh consecutive playoff appearance since they joined the league in 2010. That run has included five overall league titles, with the most recent being last year. \nBlue Mountain also kept pace with division-leading Pine Grove (13-0, 9-0). The Cardinals rolled past North Schuylkill 11-0 on Tuesday. Pine Grove beat the Eagles 4-2 on Sept. 24 and the teams will meet again Oct. 13 at the Eagles’ Nest. \nBenner set up the Eagles’ first two goals by Kylie Kutz (20 minute) and Sydney Riegel (46th) as Blue Mountain built a 2-0 advantage early in the second half. Catie Coyle scored on a penalty kick for the Crimson Tide (8-6, 5-4) in the 53rd minute to cut the deficit to one, but Kutz set up Jacey Miller in the 64th minute to set the final. \nBlue Mountain controlled \nplay on the field for the most part, holding a 15-2 advantage in shots on goal. One of the big keys to the Eagles’ win Tuesday was their passing. \n“That’s the thing we were stressing before the game and at halftime was that we are looking for that pass that creates the goal,” Blue Mountain coach Mike Burcik said. “We are looking for a nice assist were it is a simple finish for us. Making that ball move quickly creates a passing lane and I think we were able to capitalize on that.” \nBenner’s first assist came when she passed from the middle of the field to a wide open Kutz on the right wing, putting her in 1-on-1 position against Pottsville keeper Alexis Yoder. Kutz took a few dribbles up the field and drilled her shot into the right side of the net between Yoder and the post. \nBenner set up Riegel’s goal on another pass from the middle to the left wing. Riegel made a run up to the goal and buried her shot over Yoder’s head into the far corner of the net. \nKutz set up Miller’s goal when Kutz passed down to Miller, who one-timed a hard shot past Yoder. \nThe other key to Blue Mountain’s win Tuesday was its defense. The Crimson Tide came in averaging around four goals a game. \n“I think that is the nice thing when you can put the effort together on top and in the back, and limit their chances,” Burcik said. “I felt we had the better part of possession, even through we didn’t get as many goals, we still felt that getting those three goals was going to be enough thanks to the defensive side of our play.” \nThe Eagles are also getting healthy. Senior Jillian Moyer returned to the lineup last Tuesday at North Schuylkill, while keeper Lianne Derrick returned Monday against Tamaqua. \nPottsville was coming off a 7-3 loss to Pine Grove on Monday. The Crimson Tide led 2-0 early before the Cardinals pulled away in the second half. \nPottsville played the Eagles tough Tuesday as they always do, but just couldn’t get much of an attack going. Of the Crimson Tide’s two shots on goal, one was Coyle’s penalty kick. \n“We couldn’t generate offense on them,” Pottsville coach Robert Stock said. “We weren’t in our game today. I am not taking anything away from them, but we had a tough game at Pine Grove last night. So back-to-back games, and we have Tamaqua tomorrow night.” \nPottsville’s league playoff hopes are done, but a win at Tamaqua tonight will clinch a District 11 Class AAA playoff berth for the Crimson Tide. \nGame Summary \nPotts (8-6, 5-4) 0 1 — 1 \nBM (10-4, 8-1) 1 2 — 3 \nBM — Kutz (Benner), 19:45 \nPotts — Coyle (penalty kick), 52:56 \nBM — Miller (Kutz), 63:52 \nShots on goal: Pottsville 2, Blue Mountain 15. Corner kicks : Pottsville 0, Blue Mountain 6. Saves : Pottsville (Yoder) 12, Blue Mountain (Derrick) 1. \nJV score: Blue Mountain 1-0 We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

      "text": "I see this happening around our little ones\u0027 lives.\nThe girl is already asking why she is not gifted any superhero toy, but always her brother gets them. She likes superheros over other girly characters like elsa or dora. But our visitors always make sure she gets some pinky toys, while gifting superheros to her bro.\nShe recognize it as unfair, and I support her.\nSo, I ensure they both play together with all the toys. There shouldn\u0027t be any discrimination based on gender. I already mentioned to them that it is OK to like superheros, and dislike elsa. She is happy.\nMy son is learning via his dad that it is perfectly OK to wash cloths, and cook in the kitchen as much as he wants. There is no rule that men shouldn\u0027t do household chores. So, he helps me with simple chores (he is only 5 +) and never thinks it is women\u0027s role.\nBoth of my kids see that both of their parents go to work. They see that both of their parents drive the car, ride the bike, and go out, meet with people... and mostly we do not differentiate our tasks as per the gender.\nThere are days I work with the building contractors, and climb up to the top floor to inspect the work. My kids have seen it too.\nLikewise, there are days when my H controlled the kitchen too. Again, my kids witnessed both.\nWe ensure we watch selective TV programs, and not necessarily gender specific. I watch cricket interestingly, whereas my H watch movies a lot.\nOnce my son said mom should watch TV serials, and dad should watch cricket because that\u0027s how it is in her friend\u0027s place. But I clarified him, and said both the programs are for both and there is no rule as to who should watch what. But if women like serials the most, then it is ok for them to watch it.\nThere is a gender box, and that\u0027s where we all are locked in. Jumping out of the box has been always a problem for the women in the past. Now that we have somewhat managed to jumped out.\nBut men never had a reason to jump out of the box all these while. Now that they are trying to come out, but it is not that easy. At least we must make our little sons aware of all this, and the need to be out of the gender box.\nEg: a woman is allowed to work outside and earn a salary easily. But a man has so much social taboo to stay at home or look after the house.\nA woman is allowed to wear jeans and Ts, but men is not allowed to wear a women\u0027s cloth",

      "text": "  \nLONDON: Electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf may look no different from the standard family runaround. But the new materials that go into them could revolutionize the market for metals used in the industry, opening up a new field for commodities investors. \n“We identified electric vehicles as an area where we are at an inflection point for demand,” said Duncan Goodwin, portfolio manager of the Baring Global Resources Fund. \nAround 12 percent of the fund’s US$378.2 million in assets is exposed to materials that are used in electric vehicles. It has investments in New York-listed Albemarle and Australia’s Orocobre , two companies producing lithium, a key element in electric car batteries. Shares in both companies have risen sharply this year. \nGovernments, keen to push growth in electric cars in a bid to meet their carbon emissions targets, are tempting consumers with perks like subsidies, free parking and tax breaks. Growth in the market is in turn creating an opportunity for commodities investments currently estimated at US$235 billion. \nBut it is not a simple one-way bet. \nPredicting how much of any metal will be needed to meet demand for electric vehicles in the longer term is tough and advances in battery technology could alter the mixture. \nGetting drivers to adopt electric cars remains a challenge – the need to charge them up frequently and time taken to do so have put off many potential buyers. \nStill, concerns over the pollution created by diesel-powered vehicles mean that electric car prototypes dominated the Paris car show last week. \nThe number of electric and hybrid vehicles on the road worldwide surpassed 1 million last year, according to the International Energy Agency. \nWhile estimates vary, IHS Automotive expects electric vehicles to represent nearly 4 percent of all light vehicles worldwide by 2020, equivalent to 3.9 million cars, up from just over 14,000 in 2010. \nSo what sits below the bonnet in these vehicles? \nMost electric car batteries use lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathodes and graphite anodes. “Rare earth” metals dysprosium, neodymium and terbium, chiefly mined in China by companies including Xiamen Tungsten and China Minmetals Rare Earth Co , are used in some electronic components of the motor. \n“It’s clear that electric cars from today’s point of view will have lithium ion-based batteries,” said Horst Friedrich, director of Germany’s Institute of Vehicle Concepts. \n“We’re talking about lithium, and… metals like cobalt, iron phosphate, rare earth elements.” \nLITHIUM TRIANGLE \nMuch of the world’s lithium comes from an area called the “Lithium triangle” in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Mining it is an increasingly lucrative business. \nPrices of battery grade lithium in China, the biggest lithium ion battery producer, surged to above US$20,000 a tonne this summer, nearly three times higher than a year earlier, as demand grew. \n“The lithium industry is going from 160,000 tonnes of LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) today to at least 260,000 tonnes by 2020,” said Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. \nAlbemarle is investing an undisclosed sum to boost its production of battery-grade lithium salts to try to supply half of that projected demand growth, said John Mitchell, the president of Albemarle’s lithium unit. \nAustralia’s Lithium Power International is preparing its Maricunga Salar project in northern Chile to be able to ship lithium directly to China for use in electric vehicles, and aims to be in production by 2019-2020. \nAustralian rival Orocobre , whose share price has risen by more than 50 percent this year, has nearly completed a scoping study with the aim of at least doubling production capacity over the next two years at a facility in Argentina. \nAmong South American companies, Chile’s SQM announced this month that it was investing US$30 million to boost its lithium hydroxide capacity by 7,500 tonnes. \n“The market penetration of electric vehicles in the automotive market will have a significant impact on lithium demand,” it said. \n“BUYER BEWARE” \nCritics caution against expecting shortages of lithium as there is an abundance of it in the earth’s crust. Others warn against jumping too quickly into smaller companies that may not produce the high grade lithium needed for the batteries. \n“It’s very much buyer beware, it’s a fast-moving market, and there is a large degree of ignorance about it,” Finntech analyst Martin Potts said, adding that graphite could be more interesting for investors. \nChina dominates the sector for graphite, used in anodes. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects 150,000-170,000 tonnes of extra anode grade graphite will be needed by 2020, worth an extra US$1.125-1.275 billion. \nCanada’s Eagle Graphite said while the impact of electric vehicles on its business is still to be felt, when global production hits around 1 million cars per year, the draw on graphite supplies will become significant. \n“The more forward-looking manufacturers are rightly becoming concerned about long term supply,” its CEO Jamie Deith said. “Not only is there the question of producing enough graphite, but the fact that China accounts for 100 percent of natural graphite anodes today is an additional concern.” \n“The battery industry has to diversify sources.” \nMeanwhile cobalt prices , up 16 percent this year, are expected to rise another 45 percent by 2020. The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency starting to stockpile cobalt compounds highlights their importance. \nSherritt International , one of the largest cobalt producers, said it is set to increase cobalt production at its Ambatovy mine in Madagascar in line with nickel output. \nAs cobalt is mined largely as a by-product of other metals such as nickel and copper, it is hard for producers to crank up output in response to higher demand, it said. That lack of supply elasticity could push prices higher. \nNot all metals used in car batteries have a rosy future. Demand for manganese, a common component in steel, is expected to remain weak in the near term as the steel sector suffers. \n“NICE DRIVE” \nPredicting how much of any given metal would be needed to meet demand for electric vehicles in the longer term is tough and advances in battery technology could alter the amounts. \nMetals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese may not be needed in batteries such as the lithium sulfur battery being developed by Oxis Energy, based in the English city of Oxford. \nAlso in the background are green vehicle technologies, most notably hydrogen fuel cells, being mooted as possible rivals to batteries. But developing new technology to the point where it can be commercialized takes time. \n“We consider the risk of substitution of lithium to be very low,” said CRU Group’s Julia Ralph. \nGuiding the silent, top-of-the-range Leaf around a showroom complex at Nissan London West, salesman Keith Almansury says education is the key to driving growth in the segment. \n“If people don’t love electric cars, it’s because they don’t know about electric cars,” he said, flagging up benefits including environmental friendliness, savings on fuel and servicing, and free parking. “But above all, it’s just a really nice drive.” \n(Reporting by Jan Harvey; Additional reporting by Rosalba O’Brien in Santiago, Jim Regan in Sydney; Editing by Pratima Desai, Keith Weir, Janet McBride)",

      "text": "By MEG KINNARD and MARTHA WAGGONER\nAssociated Press CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Less than a year after a devastating motorcycle wreck that friends say left him muddled and struggling, Keith Lamont Scott was shot to death by Charlotte police officers who said he refused to drop a gun.\nNeurologists say they aren\u0027t surprised that someone with a severe traumatic brain injury would be slow to react and have difficulty following instructions, particularly when orders are being shouted by police officers with their weapons drawn.\n\"They don\u0027t do well in stressful situations,\" said Dr. David Brody, professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. \"They often make poor choices or impulsive decisions under stress.\"\nBrody noted that his comments refer to severe TBIs in general, and that he never saw Scott as a patient. But he said \"there\u0027s no way a patient with a TBI who doesn\u0027t know the difference between right and wrong should own a gun or drive a car.\"\nScott was killed Sept. 20 by a Charlotte police officer, prompting days of protests that included another man\u0027s shooting death one riotous night. Body camera and dashcam recordings released by the police department show Scott slowly backing out of an SUV. Police say he refused commands to put down a gun.\nGraphic, 16-minute video released Tuesday night captures the moments just before and after the shooting, with officers treating Scott\u0027s gunshot wounds and one officer telling his colleague to \"stay right here with the gun.\" Scott can be heard moaning as officers ask his name and one encourages him to \"stay with us.\"\nScott\u0027s final moments also were recorded by his wife, Rakeyia, in a video shared widely on social media. She can be heard shouting to police that her husband \"doesn\u0027t have a gun, he has a TBI.\" She pleads with the officers not to shoot before a burst of gunfire can be heard.\nPolice Chief Kerr Putney said officers recovered a gun Scott had in his possession, but none of the videos conclusively shows that. Scott\u0027s mother maintains he was holding a Quran.\nAfter running his motorcycle into a tree in November 2015, Scott struggled to recover from two broken hips and a broken pelvis as well as his brain injury, his mother told a TV station.\n\"You could look at him and tell something was wrong,\" said Dana Chapman, a former neighbor. \"You could walk up to him; you didn\u0027t have to speak. You could look at him and tell there was a problem.\"\nChapman said he would see Scott walking twice a day, leaning on a wooden cane for support. \"He had to learn how to talk again, how to walk again,\" Chapman said.\nAnother neighbor, Anthony Spain, said Scott must have zoned out as police were yelling at him.\n\"He was like a baby,\" Spain told the Gaston Gazette, comparing his friend to an Alzheimer\u0027s patient. \"They killed a baby.\"\nTBIs range in their severity. But if Scott had to relearn how to walk and talk, he likely suffered an injury acute enough to permanently affect brain function, according to Jeffrey S. Kutcher, national Director of the Sports Neurology Clinic at the CORE Institute, in Brighton, Michigan. That \"can lead to devastating changes in behavior, impulse control and really, any cognitive function.\"\n\"Not having an appropriate response in a stressful, chaotic event is certainly a potential effect of a TBI,\" added Kutcher, director of the NBA\u0027s concussion program. Kutcher, who also never treated Scott, said the \"zoning-out\" Scott\u0027s friends described could be a direct effect of the TBI or medications.\nThe family stopped talking with the media after Scott\u0027s brother-in-law, Ray Dotch, objected to questions about Scott\u0027s criminal background, saying he shouldn\u0027t have to \"humanize him in order for him to be treated fairly.\"\n\"What we know and what you should know about him is that he was an American citizen who deserved better,\" Dotch said.\nScott had several convictions and served time in prison, court records show. As a teenager, he pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence. He later served six years in Texas for evading arrest with a vehicle and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and was released in 2011.\nCourt documents also show Scott\u0027s wife filed a restraining order a month before his accident, when she said he threatened to kill her and her son with a gun and hit the boy with his fist. Rakeyia Scott warned law officers then to be aware that he \"carries a 9mm black\" gun, and checked boxes to indicate her husband had neither a county-issued permit to buy a handgun nor a state permit to carry a concealed handgun. Rakeyia Scott later dropped her request.\n___\nWaggoner reported from Raleigh. Follow Kinnard and Waggoner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and http://twitter.com/mjwaggonernc .

I\u0027ve checked Careem and this is priced at AED 114. Is this over or under. We\u0027ll need two cars since it\u0027s 6 people and luggages. Also any good recommendatiosn of companies to drop us of in a minivan or 7 seater would be helpful. Thanks",

      "text": "I have a 2005 jeep Cherokee that was over heating. Nothing was leaking from the engine or cooling system. I flushed to radiator and block by installing a T in the cooling intake hose and flushed with a hose. In testing it, it overheated again. I had antifreeze solution and filled the engine and waited as I was a short distance from my son\u0027s house. I had to do this one more time before I got there.\nJA: Have you checked the coolant? Have you checked for a leak in the cooling system?\nCustomer: I then called for a tow to a shop to have it looked over. I brought it in at closing of the shop, 6PM. I told the mechanic what happened. He then called me about 8:30 am the next morning telling me that it needed a water pump. I am 71 yrs old and had many cars with bad water pumps that always leaked. This one never leaked.\nJA: Are you fixing your Cherokee yourself? What have you tried so far?\nCustomer: The mechanic them called me telling me he put in the water pump but it is still overheating and telling me that the head may have blown a gasket. Told me that the car was driven without coolant. I told him that I told him when it was brought in that I drove it once a short distance because there was no shoulder to stop when the temp gauge maxed out.\nJA: Anything else you want the mechanic to know before I connect you?\nCustomer: I believe he did not do any analytic s before assuming it was a water pump. I am upset about this and told him I will pay him for tow and part but no labor. He insists that he could not diagnose any further until he put in the water pump. Is this true?",

      "text": "Originally Posted by Topic-Modz Ok guys, I think I have some important information to get this shit working. But first I have to say, my English is not perfect!\nWell. Today, I tried everything... Realy everything!\nMy first try was to transfer a modded character which was created at 2016/04/03. The stats were: Everything unlocked, lvl 320, 600mio on the bank. It worked! I was able to transfer this character without any problems.\nMy second try was to transfer another account, which had exactly the same creating date and the same stats. What happend? It didn\u0027t work!\nAfter these accounts, i tried to transfer the following ones:\n-character with everything unlocked, but with low level and no money: Didn\u0027t work.\n-character with nothing unlocked, only low level and some money: Didn\u0027t work.\n-character with nothing: Didn\u0027t work.\nAll characters were more than one month old, some of them were over a half year old. Some creating dates were real and some were edited with a tool, but I was not able to transfer them! It does not depend on the creating date, that\u0027s wrong!!\nFor me, there are only two options left:\n1. It\u0027s a bug. But why should Ro need that much time to fix a litte bug? And why should they send weird mails to us with something about the terms and conditions for transfers?\n2. Maybe they log IPs and now we are able to transfer only one account per IP. I have some friends, they could only transfer the first account too.\nWhat do you think? :-) I\u0027ve tested the \"transfer ban\" theory and had R* look at an account and ask them why it wouldn\u0027t transfer. Obviously they told me I was a cheater and would never be able to transfer but I got it to transfer the other day.\nMaybe try again in a few days or lower the money/rank a bit..\nYesterday, 07:00 PM #3092 Topic-Modz Keeper Topic-Modz Keeper 13 Posts 30 Reputation 12 Credits Member May 2015 NextGenUpdate Wtf... This \"bug\" is going more crazy with every day. I hope it will work again soon.\nThank\u0027s for your answer :-)\nYesterday, 07:55 PM #3093 Officialfreskoe Grunt Officialfreskoe Grunt 56 Posts 110 Reputation 144 Credits Member Jan 2016 NextGenUpdate No solution yet? Ive transfer 2 accounts already that were 2-3 months old\nYesterday, 08:46 PM #3094 nrgman1973 Vault dweller nrgman1973 Vault dweller 559 Posts 2,280 Reputation 850 Credits Member Oct 2015 NextGenUpdate Just helped a kid transfer his.. it was rank 1000 just over the 30 day marker . Just so you know it is working still.

Had 500 million but was only rank 200 ( didn\u0027t want to take any chances )\nMy question is how are the people doing the services trasnfering accounts? Do they just have a stock pile of old psn accounts or do they rely on their customers to have 30 day old characters?\nYesterday, 10:57 PM #3096 X-UNDEAD_NINJA2 Big Sister X-UNDEAD_NINJA2 Big Sister 966 Posts 3,946 Reputation 1,513 Credits Member Jul 2013 NextGenUpdate Originally Posted by nrgman1973 Just helped a kid transfer his.. it was rank 1000 just over the 30 day marker .

      "text": "Update: Fatal accident on N9 The vehicle that was involved in the accident. Photo: Hannes Visser. OUDTSHOORN NEWS - The driver of a VW Jetta who lost control of the vehicle on the Outeniqua Pass road on Sunday 2 October lost his life and the female passenger is in a critical condition in the George Hospital. It is believed the couple is from George. The accident took place on the N9 approximately 250 meters before the Oudtshoorn turn-off. A motorcyclist Frans De Winnaar (53), Service Manager at Halfway Toyota, who was behind the Jetta on his Kawasaki in the direction of Uniondale, was taken to the George Mediclinic with serious back injuries. De Winnaar went into surgery on Monday 3 October and was moved out of ICU the next day. This was the second accident on this road during the weekend. On Saturday a woman sustained minor injuries when her vehicle rolled in the pass due to the wet, slippery conditions. Hannes Visser, Editor of the Oudtshoorn Courant, was at the scene of the fatal accident and said the Jetta skidded on the gravel on the left hand shoulder of the road and then careened out of control. “The car hit the rock face about 30 meters from where it left the road and must have rolled several times before coming to a halt another 30 metres from the site of the initial impact. Both occupants were flung from the vehicle. The car\u0027s engine tore loose from the chassis and landed in the road near the injured. The man was declared dead on the scene and the woman was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition.\" De Winnaar’s wife Christelle told the George Herald that her husband said that suddenly the road was strewn with rocks and debris from the impact of the accident. \"Frans swerved and lost control of his bike. Normally I ride pillion with him, but on Sunday morning he just took the bike for a short run to charge the battery as we haven’t gone out on a ride due to the inclement weather for quite some time. When Frans phoned to say he was involved in an accident, I thought he was pulling my leg.\"",

      "text": "  \nLOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO: Clamshell grills are making burger flipping obsolete at McDonald’s, Johnny Rockets and other burger chains. Digital kiosks, tabletop tablets and mobile phones are taking orders at eateries like Panera, Chili’s Grill \u0026 Bar and Domino’s. And at Silicon Valley start-up Zume, robots are being programmed to take over pizza assembly. \nSuch labor-saving devices have been held out as counterweights to efforts to raise the wages of the lowest paid workers in the United States. But the early evidence suggests robots and other forms of automation are merely reshaping the work of people in food service. They are not – as they have in banks, on factory floors and in other sectors – replacing them. \nIn spite of improvements in technology, minimum wage hikes between 2000 and 2008 caused little immediate displacement of workers by technology, especially in kitchens, according to a study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and DePaul University. \nThere were slightly more workers per restaurant in 2015 than in 2001, according to data compiled for Reuters by the National Restaurant Association, which opposes minimum wage hikes. \nAnd the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected leisure industry jobs, a broad category that includes restaurants, will grow at 0.6 percent annually, keeping pace with the national average through 2024. \nAutomation in the restaurant industry looms large in the heated campaign to raise entry level pay to US$15 an hour, more than double what U.S. federal law now mandates. \nRestaurants employ more low-wage workers than any other industry, and their operators are among the most vocal opponents of minimum wage hikes. Several executives have said major pay hikes would force the fast-food industry to ramp up automation, an investment that would cost thousands of jobs. \n“The numbers just don’t work for raising the minimum wage this dramatically,” said Andrew Puzder, CEO of Carl’s Jr parent CKE Restaurants Inc. “It will kill jobs.” \nRobotics researchers, restaurant executives, industrial engineers, consultants and economists said, however, automation in the restaurant and fast-food sectors is not as simple as installing automatic tellers in banks or employing robots to assemble cars. \nWhile any rise in the minimum wage puts pressure on restaurant operators, they said a robot revolution in the US$783 billion U.S. restaurant industry is still years away. \nSixteen U.S. states have increased their minimum wages this year, and some, including California and New York, will move over several years to US$15 an hour. More states are considering such measures, and Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has vowed to increase the federal minimum wage. \n“It’s not like we’re at the precipice of a revolution where the minimum wage goes up, and all these jobs disappear,” said Ken Goldberg, a professor of engineering and director of the People and Robots Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley. \nMany kitchen jobs still are too complex for robots, which can’t multitask and don’t necessarily work safely with humans in cramped spaces, experts said. While robots excel at complex calculations and precise, repetitive tasks, they have difficulty doing some things that are easily mastered by small children – such as stacking blocks and sensing objects in space. \nMoreover, most restaurants serve a range of menu items, each of which might need numerous specialized forms of automation. Sit-down restaurants have additional tasks that are hard to automate, including setting and clearing tables, refilling coffee cups and answering questions about what’s on the menu. \nAPPETITE FOR RISK Burger King attempted a potentially sweeping automation overhaul in the 1980s. It designed machines to take orders; broil, assemble and package hamburgers; cook and portion French fries; and serve drinks. But new management came in and shelved the project. \nIt’s not clear why. Among the questions at the time was whether the machines would be a “maintenance nightmare,” but the system was never broadly tested, recalled Nelson Marchioli, who had a long career at Burger King before moving on to executive roles at El Pollo Loco and Denny’s. \n“It’s nothing that money and time can’t fix, but how much time and money do you want to invest?” Marchioli said. \nMaintenance of automated systems can be costly and, when they break down, bring operations to a screeching halt, alienating customers, restaurant operators said. \nIn other industries, such as car plants, breakdowns can be costly, but delays do not immediately frustrate consumers, in the way a late pizza angers a hungry family. \nThomas Willis, an industrial engineer who was part of Burger King’s project, said many restaurant operators still don’t have the appetite for the kind of investment risks such efforts require. \n“The fear of walking away from what works already is huge,” he said. But Silicon Valley is nurturing an appetite for risk and experimentation in the kitchen. \nMomentum Machines has built a device to make gourmet burgers “with no human interaction” and city permit data show it plans to open a restaurant in San Francisco. \nZume Pizza, a Silicon Valley delivery start-up that has raised US$5.7 million in venture capital, said robots will be building and baking pies by themselves within six months. \nAlready, a robot named Pepe squirts tomato sauce onto the dough, and it is spread by another called Marta. After people add cheese and toppings, robot Bruno gently moves the pizza from a conveyor belt to an oven. \nCo-founder Julia Collins said one of Zume’s biggest challenges is maintaining the perseverance it takes to overcome technological difficulties. It took months, for instance, to get Marta to spread the tomato sauce with enough precision to keep it from splashing it off the pizza. \nZume’s first robot workforce cost US$3 million to develop, and the company believes it will be able to start new locations for between US$750,000 and US$1 million. Once fully automated, Collins predicted, the pizzeria’s labor costs will be about 14 percent of revenue, about half the competition. \nDomino’s Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said the worldwide chain won’t embrace the Zume model any time soon. At US$250,000 to US$300,000, setting up a Domino’s location is a fraction of Zume’s estimated launch costs. And, he said, customers like seeing people in the kitchen. \n“I don’t know that people want their food out of a machine,” Doyle said. “There is magic in a hand-crafted pizza.” \nWith states and municipalities moving to raise wages, restaurant owners and their suppliers may be more inclined to invest in automation, said Juan Martinez, principal of Profitality, an industrial engineering consulting firm for restaurants. But single-task robots may not be a better option than workers, he said. \n“It is not ‘if you build it, they will come,’ since the return on investment is not there yet,” Martinez said. And Johnny Rockets keeps a grill chef visible to customers, even though its high-end burger cookers do most of the work. \nMost of the movement toward technology in restaurants has been at the front end. Eatsa, an updated automat, offers its quinoa bowls at outlets that have largely eliminated front-of-the-restaurant staff. Customers order on tablets and pick up their food minutes later from small, frosted glass cubicles. \nSeveral chains are using kiosks and other technology that allow orders to be placed more rapidly and efficiently. Such systems can pay off in two or three years, according to an analysis by Cornerstone Capital Group analyst Mike Shavel. \nDomino’s Pizza and Panera Bread Co , said their custom-built ordering and payment systems have removed bottlenecks at peak hours. \nBut the changes have not eliminated jobs; rather, they have shifted them away from counters and into kitchens and delivery, operators said. Digital ordering puts more pressure on the kitchen and delivery staffs, said Panera CEO Ron Shaich. \n“You better be able to deliver that food,” he said. \n(Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa Girion)",

Emergency lights turn on but does not flash and it turns on the rear brake lights not the rear signals. Also turn signals do not work either. Engine cranks, but obviously have no spark. Also transmission AT switch locked in park unless I manually release.\nJA: Have you checked the fuses? Have you checked the bulbs?\nCustomer: Yes. Checked all fuses and flopped some relays. Is the ICM or ECU modules blown? my daughter heard a Pop sound when it happened. She said coming more from the rear of teh car?\nJA: Are you fixing your Outback yourself? What have you tried so far?\nCustomer: I am trying to diagnose it. I just had a mechanic a few weekls back change the oil pump and fix a bunch of oil leaks.\nJA: Anything else you want the mechanic to know before I connect you?\nCustomer: I was thinking ignition switch or turn signal/light switch/harness went bad?",

      "text": "/u/Orc_ on Mexican Army Humvees after yesterdays chapo\u0027s son led ambush Man I think movies have distorted your perception on how damaging and explosive RPGs are IRL..I think that could come off as condescending, but please don\u0027t take it that way. Unless you have experience with weaponry and explosives, there\u0027s no way you\u0027d know that Hollywood ridiculously embellishes most weapon\u0027s kill-zone, per se (actually I\u0027m sure you probably realize movies are embellished, just not to which extent). For example, if you could see first hand how small of an explosion a hand grenade IRL causes compared to Hollywood\u0027s portrayal, you\u0027d be really surprised. That being said, I guarantee you, short of a bad weld or defective frame, a RPG isn\u0027t powerful enough to cause a goddamn truck to buckle like that!\nAnd when it comes to IEDs, I\u0027ve seen all kinds of variations, some of which were conventional and had only 5 pounds of explosive, and others 200 pounds...and unfortunately, I\u0027ve seen even more IEDs classified as EFPs (explosive formed projectile/penetrator), which are about as nasty and deadly as you\u0027d imagine molten copper would be. EFPs are armor-piercing and do minimal damage to the exterior of the truck or track, but in turn cause maximum damage to the occupants seated inside. So for the sake of the argument EFPs are excluded.\nBut again, most conventional IEDs in all actuality don\u0027t cause quite as much damage as you are imagining (especially to up-armored vehicles, specifically to the interior)...I\u0027ve seen literally 50 IEDs of all types detonate against personnel, humvees, MRAPS, M-1 Abrahams, and other vehicles. Only twice did the explosion cause the vehicle to become airborne, and both times the vehicle was a civilian\u0027s privately owned compact car. Although I\u0027ve never personally witnessed an unarmored humvee being blown up (which is more than likely what was being used by the Mexicans, and guess weighs half of what an uparmored one would, which is about 15K lbs.) I\u0027d be fucking shocked if an IED the cartel used had enough explosives to lift the humvee more than a few feet in the air, much less send it flying through the air like nothing.",

You\u0027re wrong. Alcohol is worse in withdrawal, alcohol is more damaging socially, economically, alcohol as a LEGAL substance leads to more crime that doesn\u0027t come from supply/demand considerations (domestic violence, car crashes, etc), and this is all under the fact that heroin, unlike alcohol, is unregulated and cut with shit. The shit is what causes the overdoses and personal harm much more than the drug (we can argue this because across the world people take medical heroin after injuries, and don\u0027t OD in nearly the same numbers). You\u0027re simply wrong. I know it can sting, but do some reading and I think you\u0027ll come around.",

      "text": "subscribe Insurer calculates how likely you are to crash into a deer based on where you live Each year, deer in the United States are involved in more than more than 1 million collisions that cause more than 200 human deaths. They also cost a lot of money, according to State Farm, the country\u0027s top auto insurer, which says the average claim hovers around $4,000. \nDeer, with their big eyes and fluffy white tails, may look innocent enough. But they kill more Americans than any other animal. \nNot that they mean to. These deaths occur when cars driven by people crash into deer that are crossing roads. And they\u0027re especially likely to happen over the next three months, when deer are friskily roaming around in search of mates to make fawns with. \nEach year, deer in the United States are involved in more than more than 1 million collisions that cause more than 200 human deaths. They also cost a lot of money, according to State Farm, the country\u0027s top auto insurer, which says the average claim hovers around $4,000. \nThe company, in its annual effort to urge people not to smash into deer, recently used its claim data to come up with rankings for where such a collision is likely to happen. The most perilous state is West Virginia, whose drivers have a 1 in 41 chance of hitting a deer. Californians can breathe easier - their chances are 1 in 1,064. \nSo what should you do to stay on the safe side of those probabilities? Definitely the basics: Buckle up, keep your eyes on the road and not your phone, pay attention to deer-crossing signs. High beams can help (but, please, don\u0027t blind oncoming drivers). And if a deer darts in front of you, don\u0027t swerve - that can cause you to run into a tree or another car. \n\"Hit the damn deer,\" a Wisconsin auto body shop owner who does lots of business in deer-damaged cars told Slate last year. \"If you have time to stop, then stop. But don\u0027t swerve and risk your neck over a deer - or worse yet, over a dog or a squirrel. Believe me, I\u0027ve seen it happen.\" \nYou could also hope for the continued spread of cougars in the United States. Researchers have determined that if the big cats repopulated the eastern United States, they could kill and feast upon enough deer to prevent about five deer-vehicle collision fatalities in the region each year.

      "text": "The leaves are falling, temperatures are dropping and winter will soon be here. While snow can be pleasant to look at, it can also wreak havoc on roadways and create hazardous driving conditions during the winter months.\nEveryone dreads the nerve-wracking winter commutes, but there’s plenty you can do to prepare your vehicle for inclement conditions. By taking a few precautionary steps in advance of the drop in temperatures, you can make sure your vehicle is better equipped for safe, smooth travel during the colder months.\nTires are one of the most important factors of safe winter driving; they can be the difference between a safe commute and a ride in a tow truck.\n“It’s crucial for drivers to be conscious of what type of tires are ideal for their region’s climate and driving conditions,” says Matti Morri, technical customer service manager, Nokian T y res — the inventor of the winter tire. “Too often, drivers think all-season tires are satisfactory for all conditions, which puts them in an unsafe position during the winter months. Even the most mechanically sound vehicle is no match for winter without proper tires.”\nTake the time to make sure your tires are in optimal condition before the first snowfall to make the picturesque beauty of winter more enjoyable.\n1. Make sure your tires are suited for the conditions.\nWhether a driver needs all-season, all-weather or winter tires depends on the climate the driver is based in.\n* All-season tires perform best in temperatures of 40 degrees Fahrenheit and above. For most of the country, this means they are ideally suited for spring, summer and fall driving. If you don’t experience snowy, slippery conditions in the winter, all-season tires are sufficient.\n* All-weather tires can be used year-round and still provide excellent handling in the snow. All-weather tires are ideal for drivers that experience four seasons but are not designed to withstand the harsher winters in the northern regions.\n* Winter tires are designed to grip in colder, winter conditions, not just in snow. These tires provide extreme grip in weather below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter tread patterns are also designed to provide excellent grip in icy and snowy conditions. Winter tires are engineered specifically to perform most effectively in harsh environments where colder temperatures are the norm. They don’t just combat snow and ice, they’re specifically designed and tested to function better in areas where temperatures can drop down well below freezing.\n2. Monitor tire pressure.\nOnce you’ve found the proper tire for your climate, it’s important to closely monitor the tire pressure. As the temperature drops, tire pressure falls with it. In fact, for every 10-degree drop in temperature, tire pressure decreases by 1 pound per square inch.\nLow inflation can cause a number of problems with your vehicle. It increases fuel consumption, shortens the life of your tires and creates an unsafe driving experience, as if you don’t already have enough to worry about while driving in the snow.\nTire pressure should be inspected at least once a month and always before a long trip. So grab a tire pressure gauge and your vehicle’s owner manual before hitting the road this winter.\n3. Monitor and rotate your tires.\nOnce your tires are properly inflated, take a look at the tread. Tires are considered legally worn out when they reach 2/32nds of an inch. To err on the side of caution, replace your tires when they reach 5/32nds of the remaining tread depth for winter driving. One way to check is to insert a U.S. penny into the main groove so that the edge of the coin touches the tread and Lincoln\u0027s head is upside down. If the top of Lincoln\u0027s head remains visible from the groove, the tires are fully worn.\nTires need more tread depth during the winter to compress snow in their grooves and release it as they roll. Insufficient tread depth sacrifices the vehicle’s traction and mobility in the snow. You should monitor the tread depth closely throughout the winter and rotate the tires at least every 7,500 miles.\nHaving proper tires is just the beginning of safe winter driving. Visit a mechanic prior to the first snow to get the rest of your vehicle checked out, and in case all else fails, make sure you have an emergency kit in you car. Drive at a speed that’s appropriate for the weather conditions and stay calm. Drivers should always approach winter driving with extreme caution and use their best judgment before hitting the road. Sometimes even the most prepared driver is no match for Mother Nature.",

      "text": "Rosberg reveals Vettel apologised to him for Malaysian GP clash \nInternational Travel News (ANI) Wednesday 5th October, 2016 \nJohannesburg [South Africa], Oct.5 (ANI): World championship leader Nico Rosberg has revealed that Red Bull\u0027s Sebastian Vettel called him after the Malaysian Grand Prix to apologise for their collision at the first corner. \nThe Mercedes driver was spun round at Turn 1 by Ferrari driver Vettel, who was attempting to pass his team-mate Max Verstappen on the inside at the start. \nEarlier, Vettel had indirectly blamed his team-mate Verstappen for the incident, but it seems that he has now changed his mind after being deemed that it was predominately his fault by the racing stewards. \n\"Sebastian just called me actually. He apologised, which is nice. It doesn\u0027t get me back the points that I lost, but it\u0027s still nice to hear that,\" Rosberg was quoted as saying by Sport24. \nRosberg said that he thought his race was over after being hit in the rear by his fellow German, but added that he was glad to fight his way back and finish the race at the third spot. \n\"Of course I spin turned it as quickly as possible and got going, and surprisingly the car was still okay. The thing is, it got a bit damaged but still more or less okay to drive it. I was really surprised. Then of course, full attack - that was all I could do. It was quite enjoyable at times to fight through the pack like that and pass left, right everywhere,\" he said. \nWhile Vettel was handed a three-place grid penalty for this weekend\u0027s Japanese Grand Prix, Rosberg extended his gap over team-mate Lewis Hamilton in driver standings from eight to 23 points with five races remaining.

      "text": "A woman is dead and a 45-year-old man is in custody after barricading himself in the backyard of his Summerlin home for hours Tuesday afternoon after a fatal shooting.\nThe woman killed was in her 80s, and she was shot in the middle of the street on the 2100 block of Henniker Way, near Lake Mead and Rampart boulevards, Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Larry Hadfield said.\nFor hours, Metro’s SWAT team tried to negotiate with the suspect, whom police identified as the woman’s grandson, Bradley Christian Francis. He was sitting in the backyard of his Henniker Way home, armed.\nBy 8 p.m., he exited the yard and surrendered to police, who arrested him.\nFrancis was booked into Clark County Detention Center on a murder charge. His first court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.\nA 35-year-old neighbor, who did not want to be named, said he was inside his home when he heard a loud bang about 4:30 p.m.\nHe thought it came from inside, possibly a toilet seat slamming down. But when he walked outside about a minute later, he saw his neighbor lying in the street.\nJudging by her obvious head trauma, he thought she had fallen or been hit by a car, he said. He began to render aid but she wasn’t responsive.\n“I was talking to her, trying to get her talking,” he said. At the same time, he said he was on the phone with 911. \nHe stayed with the woman for about five minutes, he said, as police were on their way. That’s when a second neighbor, who had a concealed carry permit and weapon, opened her door and shouted at him to go back inside.\n“The guy who shot her is still here!” the woman yelled, according to the neighbor. So, he ran back inside and hunkered down with his children.\n“The scariest thing of all was the realization that it was a gunshot wound, and that she is my neighbor,” the man said.\nThe woman shot was pronounced dead on the scene shortly after officers arrived, Metro homicide Lt. Dan McGrath said.\nPolice are investigating whether an altercation occurred inside the home before the shooting, because a few neighbors told police the woman killed was already bloody when she came outside.\nAnother family member in his late teens was in the home during the shooting but came outside just as the barricade began, McGrath said. The young man was not harmed.\nNeither the woman nor the suspect had a criminal history, according to police, and Metro didn’t have a record Tuesday night of any previous domestic incidents at the address.\nDuring the barricade, residents in the immediate area were evacuated as a precaution.\nThe county coroner’s office will name the woman killed once her immediate family has been notified.\nThe neighbor who tried to help her said he channeled his more than 14 years of military experience when he charged toward her bleeding body.\n“She’s a supersweet lady. They’re probably the nicest neighbors I have,” the man said. “It’s a horrific sight.”\nContact Rachel Crosby at rcrosby@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5290.

      "text": "Yes sir, I have have been in that crazy situation twice.\nOnce when I was young and my parents were towing their new TT with moms Oldsmobile. We towed it from southern Ontario back to northwestern Ontario, some 800 miles or about 1350 km. This was not so much weight issues as the weight of the tow vehicle and going down a long hill, tail wagging hte dog kind of situation. It was crazy and I remember as a kid seeing the TT out the side window at one point. Dad masterfully got it back under control with no damage. Weight police take it easy. Towing with a car was common practice back then and the TT was only 20\u0027.\nI then had it happen to me the first time I carried my racecar on a newly purchased used racecar trailer. Pretty hairy situation just as I was getting up to speed on the highway. I got it back under control and cruised slowly to the track. We put a bunch of weight out front to keep it tracking right after that. I guess it was designed with the intention of a bigger toolbox, spare parts and rack full of tires up front.\nNonetheless It is seriously dangerous and can get out of control very easily.\nBoth times it probably looked a lot like that video.",

(AP) — Testimony is scheduled to resume in the trial of a Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside a hot SUV. The trial of Justin Ross Harris enters its third day Wednesday in coastal Brunswick, where the case was moved 275 miles from the Atlanta suburbs because of pretrial publicity. Prosecutors say Harris intentionally killed his 22-month-old son, Cooper, by leaving the child for seven hours in a vehicle parked outside the father\u0027s Cobb County workplace. Harris\u0027 defense lawyer Maddox Kilgore told the jury in his opening statement Tuesday that Harris is certainly responsible for his son\u0027s death, but insisted it was an accident and Harris committed no crime. The trial of Harris, who moved to Georgia from Alabama in 2012, is expected to last several weeks. Today\u0027s Deals",

(AP) — Less than a year after a devastating motorcycle wreck that friends say left him muddled and struggling, Keith Lamont Scott was shot to death by Charlotte police officers who said he refused to drop a gun. Neurologists say they aren\u0027t surprised that someone with a severe traumatic brain injury would be slow to react and have difficulty following instructions, particularly when orders are being shouted by police officers with their weapons drawn. \"They don\u0027t do well in stressful situations,\" said Dr. David Brody , professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri. \"They often make poor choices or impulsive decisions under stress.\" Brody noted that his comments refer to severe TBIs in general, and that he never saw Scott as a patient. But he said \"there\u0027s no way a patient with a TBI who doesn\u0027t know the difference between right and wrong should own a gun or drive a car.\" Scott was killed Sept. 20 by a Charlotte police officer, prompting days of protests that included another man\u0027s shooting death one riotous night. Body camera and dashcam recordings released by the police department show Scott slowly backing out of an SUV. Police say he refused commands to put down a gun. Graphic, 16-minute video released Tuesday night captures the moments just before and after the shooting, with officers treating Scott\u0027s gunshot wounds and one officer telling his colleague to \"stay right here with the gun.\" Scott can be heard moaning as officers ask his name and one encourages him to \"stay with us.\" Scott\u0027s final moments also were recorded by his wife, Rakeyia, in a video shared widely on social media. She can be heard shouting to police that her husband \"doesn\u0027t have a gun, he has a TBI.\" She pleads with the officers not to shoot before a burst of gunfire can be heard. Police Chief Kerr Putney said officers recovered a gun Scott had in his possession, but none of the videos conclusively shows that. Scott\u0027s mother maintains he was holding a Quran. After running his motorcycle into a tree in November 2015, Scott struggled to recover from two broken hips and a broken pelvis as well as his brain injury, his mother told a TV station. \"You could look at him and tell something was wrong,\" said Dana Chapman , a former neighbor. \"You could walk up to him; you didn\u0027t have to speak. You could look at him and tell there was a problem.\" Chapman said he would see Scott walking twice a day, leaning on a wooden cane for support. \"He had to learn how to talk again, how to walk again,\" Chapman said. Another neighbor, Anthony Spain , said Scott must have zoned out as police were yelling at him. \"He was like a baby,\" Spain told the Gaston Gazette, comparing his friend to an Alzheimer\u0027s patient. \"They killed a baby.\" TBIs range in their severity. But if Scott had to relearn how to walk and talk, he likely suffered an injury acute enough to permanently affect brain function, according to Jeffrey S. Kutcher , national Director of the Sports Neurology Clinic at the CORE Institute , in Brighton, Michigan. That \"can lead to devastating changes in behavior, impulse control and really, any cognitive function.\" \"Not having an appropriate response in a stressful, chaotic event is certainly a potential effect of a TBI,\" added Kutcher, director of the NBA \u0027s concussion program. Kutcher, who also never treated Scott, said the \"zoning-out\" Scott\u0027s friends described could be a direct effect of the TBI or medications. The family stopped talking with the media after Scott\u0027s brother-in-law, Ray Dotch , objected to questions about Scott\u0027s criminal background, saying he shouldn\u0027t have to \"humanize him in order for him to be treated fairly.\" \"What we know and what you should know about him is that he was an American citizen who deserved better,\" Dotch said. Scott had several convictions and served time in prison, court records show. As a teenager, he pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and received a 12-month suspended sentence. He later served six years in Texas for evading arrest with a vehicle and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and was released in 2011. Court documents also show Scott\u0027s wife filed a restraining order a month before his accident, when she said he threatened to kill her and her son with a gun and hit the boy with his fist. Rakeyia Scott warned law officers then to be aware that he \"carries a 9mm black\" gun, and checked boxes to indicate her husband had neither a county-issued permit to buy a handgun nor a state permit to carry a concealed handgun. Rakeyia Scott later dropped her request. ___ Waggoner reported from Raleigh. Follow Kinnard and Waggoner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and http://twitter.com/mjwaggonernc .

Why would you even consider a Prius Prime when you can have a Volt that doubles the electric distance of the Prius, has one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings and supports jobs over here.

The injuries resulting from this far outweigh any potential safety effect in crashes, given how rare school bus crashes are, how big school buses are compared to cars, and how ineffective mere lap belts, generally not well tightened, would generally be in a school bus crash.",

The actual Lifetime service for balancing a tire is limited to ten years. The service contract limit is not based on tire wear or condition, and not on the ability to safely balance a tire, and not by contract terms, but simply because a tire\u0027s Lifetime is now considered to be ten years.\nRegardless of warranty or service contract, I am having difficulty finding a shop that does not have a prohibition on balancing older tires, even when I offer to pay.\nAnyone else run into the problem?\nWhat do you do to get older tires balanced?",

A DPF reburn will put a lot of fuel in the sump.\nThat was not my experience with the Mercedes diesels we had in the past.\nOn a morning cold enough to be on the cusp of not starting at all if left sitting out all night, around 4F, you could run the glow plugs and start the engine and after ten or fifteen minutes idling, the coolant temp needle would be well off the peg and you\u0027d have actual heat in the car.",

      "text": "A National Diploma holder of a polytechnic in Delta State, Anene Odikose, has been arrested by the Ogun State Police Command for impersonation. A police uniform, an identity card bearing his name and a Honda car were said to have been recovered from him by operatives attached to the Anti-Robbery Squad of the Agbado divisio\n\nPunch learnt that the team apprehended 31-year-old Odikose on Monday during a stop-and-search at a checkpoint on Matogun Road, Oke-Aro, in the Ifo Local Government Area of the state, where he lives.\n\nThe suspect, who hails from Aniocha North, Delta State, had reportedly hid under the Force to defraud and harass unsuspecting members of the public before luck ran out on him.\n\nIn a chat with Punch correspondent, Odikose said he was dismissed in 2011 while undergoing training at the police college in Rivers State.\n\nHe said the shame of returning home made him to approach a police friend, who assisted him in obtaining the uniform and the ID card after he paid N500.\n\nHe said, “I am an ND holder in Business Administration. I was enlisted in the police in October 2011. During the 15-month training at the police college in Rivers State, some officers came from Abuja to screen us. Unfortunately, I was dismissed on the grounds of physical fitness.\n\n“When I left the college, I was shy to go back to the village and tell my people that I had been disqualified. I went to live with a brother in Asaba (Delta State).\n\n“When my friends completed the training, I met with one of them, Henry, who was posted to Calabar, Cross River State. He collected N500 from me and helped me process a police ID card. He also gave me a police uniform.”\n\nOdikose, however, denied using the ID card and the uniform to commit crime, saying he only tendered the ID card at checkpoints to evade police interrogation whenever he drove out his car, whose documents were incomplete.\n\nThe Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the case would be charged to court after investigation.

      "text": "Tweet \nTelstra teamed up with Cohda Wireless to trial so-called ‘vehicle-to-everything’ (V2X) technology over the operator’s LTE network in South Australia. \nThe trial covered applications such as alerting a driver to roadworks ahead, giving green light priority to high priority vehicles and providing optimal traffic signal timing where the vehicle is informed of the most suitable speed to approach a traffic light so it’s a green light when the car arrives. \nTelstra director of technology Andrew Scott said the trial confirms 4G can support vehicle-to-infrastructure applications. \nHe said it marks the first phase of its V2X project, with additional trial phases lined up for testing vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vulnerable (bicycles and pedestrians). “We are particularly excited about the upcoming vehicle-to-vulnerable testing as we will be able to showcase the sending of standardised intelligent transport systems messages over the 4G network to enable interaction of vehicles with smartphone-equipped bicycles.” \nTelstra and Cohda Wireless intend to trial vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vulnerable technologies in South Australia in the coming months. \nDeployment of V2X communications is expected to lead to intelligent transport systems that allow more efficient use of road infrastructure, better traffic management, and coordinated and safe autonomous vehicle operation. \nCEO of Cohda Wireless Paul Gray said there are a number of V2X use cases that can be deployed right now using 4G. “We are very pleased to be working with Telstra towards the shared goal of making roads safer, greener, and less congested.” \nVodafone Group announced earlier in the week it is trialling new technology for vehicle-to-vehicle communication (called LTE-V2X), with the goal of improving road safety and efficiency. It is based on an extension of 4G standards, to “ensure safe, reliable communications while making the most efficient use of radio spectrum”.  ",

      "text": "Preview: Japanese Grand Prix - Round 17 \n7:32 – F1 heads straight from Sepang to Suzuka for the Japanese Grand Prix this weekend, in another back-to-back sequence. GPUpdate.net previews this weekend\u0027s visit to Suzuka and provides the key facts. Suzuka: Suzuka, opened in 1962 as a test track for Honda\u0027s road cars and motorcycles, is one of few \u0027figure of eight\u0027 circuits in the world, and is a firm favourite amongst drivers for its fast, flowing layout.It has been modified multiple times over the years, mainly to improve safety standards, but still contains famous sections and turns such as the \u0027S\u0027 Curves, the Degner Curves, Spoon Curve and 130R.Honda, currently acting as McLaren\u0027s engine partner, still owns the circuit.\"Suzuka is one of my favourite tracks – it\u0027s just got a great flow,\" says Force India\u0027s Nico Hülkenberg.\"You go from one corner straight into to the next and it\u0027s a proper old-school track; it\u0027s so much fun to drive, especially in qualifying when you have low fuel, soft tyres and lots of grip.\"You have some high-speed sections, but the main feature is the great rhythm you get.\"The track has several great corners: the best section is the Esses – it\u0027s three or four corners at once. They\u0027re all hooked up, so if you make a mistake in one you can just forget about the rest.\"The other highlight of the Japanese weekend is the fans. They are incredible: it doesn\u0027t matter what time of day it is, or what the weather is doing, they are there outside the hotel or at the track waiting for you.\"They always bring us presents – most often candy, but I once got a very cute teddy koala bear!\" Form guide: Nico Rosberg enters the Japanese Grand Prix with a sizeable 23-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, after the latter\u0027s engine failure in the closing stages of the previous Malaysia round.Hamilton, however, after challenging weekends – for various reasons – in Belgium, Italy and Singapore, proved his pace at the Sepang circuit, and will be keen to make up for the disappointment this time out.Hamilton is also a two-time winner at Suzuka, having triumphed in 2014 and 2015, and also claimed victory in Japan in 2007, when the race was held at the Fuji Speedway.Sebastian Vettel (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013), Fernando Alonso (2006), Jenson Button (2011) and Kimi Räikkönen (2005) are the other active Formula 1 drivers to have claimed victory at the circuit.Michael Schumacher tops the all-time list with six wins (1995, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004).

      "text": "When it comes to the cutthroat world of selling consumer products and services, anything peddled ‘for free’ is often sneered at and taken for useless. In the digital universe of software and video games, however, free offerings have become synonymous with value – and users have come to not only expect free, but to demand it. Jason\nOur digital lives are increasingly populated by businesses that are successfully harnessing the freemium model. Take Dropbox, for example. It is free to use, and has become a widely utilised tool for both individuals and enterprises of all sizes. In the highly lucrative gaming industry, the free-2-play model has become entrenched. When looking at the Android or Apple software charts, the top ranking earners are all free-2-play, with premium (paid) products taking up less than 10% of the spots in top charts.\nThe basic premise behind the free model is that it allows businesses to grow their audience at a rapid rate, often at no additional cost to the initial development and marketing. If the product is good and provides real value and/or entertainment, the number of users can potentially skyrocket in a short space of time. With an initial monetisation strategy in place, as this audience or user base grows, it is possible to apply clever analytics and assessments to determine how the product can be improved or enhanced to have the best chance of long-term success and ensure financial reward.\nClosing the Viral Loop \nAt first, the goal is gain as many users as possible. As a result of the product being free to use, people are more inclined to share and recommend it via their online networks, creating the desired viral effect and closing the loop. Eventually, there will be a distinct difference between the hardcore fans/users who are willing to spend money on additional products/services, and the casual, less dedicated user.\nOnce this initial adoption and natural evolution has taken place, the game or software should then give the more dedicated users the ability to purchase enhanced features or options, without ever making them feel as though they are being fleeced or taken advantage of. This is achieved through offering value-add services which don’t change the experience – but rather enhance it by giving them more, or allowing them to express themselves through customisation.\nWith regards to customisation, games are generally best suited to this tactic, but it works in any product that has a social element through which people can essentially show off – without this there is no reason to spend money on these customisations. These products keep enabling the same free experience, but they then allow people to display their skills or talents. For instance in a car game, users might be able to add decals to the car, or dress up a character – which in turn makes the user feel good in front of their social group.\nAs briefly noted above, Dropbox is an excellent example of the free model being used effectively, in that anyone can use the service at no cost, indefinitely. They have embedded viral hooks which make it easy to share with friends, and the person who shares, gets given more free space (genius!). To solve the monetisation conundrum, Dropbox then offers additional space – having recognised that their hardcore users love the product so much that they want everything to run through the platform. The additional space allows them to do that and comes at a cost, but the hardcore users happily absorb it.\nWith any app, the monetisation strategy should never allow users to pay to win, for example, making a user in a game faster or stronger and therefore more likely to win. This is a golden rule, as it is far too easy to fall into the trap of allowing your users to pay an amount which automatically makes them better than all of the others, especially non-paying users. Inevitably, this approach quickly degrades the experience for other users, which in turn will result in a drop in engagement and usage as word gets out. For both developers and marketers, the rule should be to never compromise on the promise of the free service in full – while some people may never become paying users, this lack of income is offset against the benefits of word of mouth marketing.\nSpurring Innovation \nFor the developers and marketing team behind the product, the model is wondrously cost effective. Unlike with paid products and services, whereby the marketing and sales functions have to drive uptake and get the conversations started, the free-2-play model relies on the users and their networks to drive awareness and ignite the wildfire of interest that so many digital entrepreneurs lust after. Marketing spend can then be allocated more strategically based on analytics, and once necessary improvements have been made.\nIn addition, the free-2-play model acts as an engine for innovation as well as a natural filter. Indeed, the model drastically lowers all barriers to entry that premium products have built up over the years. Premium products need to be backed by professional marketing functions (as noted above), with the business often spending more money on sales and marketing than on the development of the product. Often, those resources are mistakenly targeted at the wrong audience, or worse still, the messaging simply does not reach the desired audience – leading to a product that is a failure from Day 1. Without the high up-front costs, free-2-play allows developers to release a product, improving it steadily and then scaling when ready.\nUltimately, the free-2-play model means that teams can create a minimum viable product, get it out, grow an audience at a low cost and try to work out if the product is something that can be successful in the longer term.\nBehavioural Triggers \nAs with technology in general, the world of free-2-play is a constantly evolving arena in which tried and trusted techniques are always changing as users become conditioned to existing products. This means that new and novel ways of engaging users need to be pioneered and prototyped, creating compelling reasons for users to participate and ultimately spend money.\nIn our view, a key aspect of achieving this constant evolution is making sure that businesses understand the nuances of human psychology and behaviour. What is often overlooked is that people’s behaviour or responses are irrational and different to what is expected. Understanding these irrationalities based on learnings and experiments, and then matching the mechanics of a game or app to drive expected outcomes is crucial. By working with specialists who understand what prods people into making certain choices at certain times, businesses can harness the full potential of the free model while still gaining massive competitive advantage over their less savvy competitors. From gaming to global trade, success hinges on finding the key triggers of human behaviour – and then cleverly designing products and services around these insights.\nAbout Fuzzy Logic \nFuzzy Logic is a games, augmented reality (AR) and apps developer that is at the cutting edge of software technology. Based in George in the Western Cape, Fuzzy Logic was formed in 2011 by Gautenger, Jason Ried, and brings together top-class artists, animators and programmers, with the more experienced members having worked on technically complex, award-winning AAA video games in the UK, such as Split/Second, Disney Universe and Championship Manager.\nThe team prides itself on the ability to deliver quality, creativity and professionalism in their mobile games and apps, employing games analytics, behavioural psychology and user research to create entertaining, commercially successful products. To date, Fuzzy Logic has not only released chart-topping products, but has also won a European AR award and worked with high-profile clients such as Vodafone, Castle Lite, Woolworths, Standard Bank and Nederburg. Fuzzy Logic has just started work on a big budget, highly ambitious game for an international toy company, details of which are currently under wraps.\nAbout Jason Ried \nFuzzy Logic is the brainchild of Jason Ried, who grew up in Springs in Gauteng in the era of the ZX Spectrum. He’d rush home from school, and later work, foregoing lunch to play Pro Evo with his best friend, dreaming of the day he’d get to make his own games.\nIn 2002, Jason took a huge leap of faith and moved to the UK to pursue his dream. Starting off as a Quality Analyst at Eidos Interactive, he worked his way up to Associate Producer. He worked on big budget, AAA games such as Championship Manager, Just Cause 2, Tomb Raider, Hitman and Wacky Races, before moving to Disney Interactive Studios in 2008 where he was part of the team that produced the award-winning game Split/Second.\nIn 2011, Jason was given the opportunity to move back to South Africa to start up his own development studio. He decided to focus on the latest technology, augmented reality (AR), as well as apps and mobile games. Setting up in George, in the heart of the Garden Route with a view of the beach, Fuzzy Logic was born.\nJason’s vision for Fuzzy Logic is to create world-class games and apps while growing the games industry in South Africa which has a wealth of untapped potential and talent. To date, Jason has led Fuzzy Logic in releasing chart-topping products, winning an international award and starting work on a big budget, highly ambitious game for an international game and toy company.\n",

      "text": "Volvo Cars, with their unique cyclist detection system on certain models, have announced that they will be the official vehicle partners of the 2017 TransCape mountain bike race. Volvo Cars South Africa have come on board as vehicle partners for the TransCape MTB taking place in February next year. Photo: Supplied\nâ€œVolvo are the most human-centric car brand and our target market consists of progressive people who care about others and appreciate a life of adventure and simplicity,â€ said Michelle NaudĂŠ, marketing and communications director at Volvo Cars South Africa.\nâ€œCyclists are thus very much in focus for Volvo and we have been looking for a credible partner in the cycling world.â€\nShe said City Safety, Volvoâ€™s collection of supplementary safety features, included the world-first cyclist detection system.\nStandard on the all-new Volvo XC90 and optional on other models, the feature allows the vehicle to detect cyclists and apply preventative braking autonomously to avoid collisions or reduce the severity of impacts.\nâ€œWe want to team up with a partner which shares our values, and seize an opportunity to showcase how incredibly well our vehicles and safety systems fit in with a cycling lifestyle,â€ she said. â€œTransCape ticks all the boxes.â€\nNaudĂŠ said that although the initial agreement with the Pretoria-based company was for one year, they were already considering extending the partnership to â€œtwo to three yearsâ€.\nAccording to her, the adventurous, premium nature of the seven-day event across the Western Cape tied in with the Swedish car manufacturerâ€™s luxury ideology and their approach to making ownership less complicated.\nâ€œWe are looking forward to interacting with the participants.\nâ€œIt is a unique opportunity to get to know them and, through this networking, share our passion for our brand, demonstrate our fabulous features and show just how well we suit the mountain biking adventure lifestyle.â€\nASG Events chief executive Wynand de Villiers said the supply of support vehicles â€“ 12 Volvo XC90s â€“ was key for the organisers.\nâ€œBecause the TransCape is a full-service event, transporting the riders is one of the weekâ€™s most crucial aspects.\nâ€œThey are transported from the finish areas and race villages to their hotels and guest houses, and back again,Â on a daily basis. This year they will be riding in style.â€\nASG Events announced earlier this month that they had acquired a controlling stake in the 675 km event.\nDe Villiers said it now formed part of their repertoire of partnership events, which include the Bestmed Tour of Good Hope, Liberty Encounter Series and Sanlam MTB Invitational.\nâ€œWe are looking forward to building on the success story of this race,â€ which, he said, fitted in nicely with their current offering for high-net-worth individuals in the mountain biking arena.\nEntries are limited to 130 riders and each participant stands a chance of winning a Volvo bike carrier valued at R10Â 000.\nStarting in Knysna on February 5 next year, the race takes in the Garden Route, Klein Karoo, Overberg and Winelands regions en route to the finish in Franschhoek.\nFor more info, go to www.transcapemtb.co.za .\n",

Hurricane Matthew is expected to affect the South Carolina coast by the weekend. Gov. Nikki Haley announced Tuesday that, unless the track of the storm changes, the state will issue an evacuation order Wednesday ahead of Hurricane Matthew, so that 1 million people can safely and comfortably leave the coast. Mic Smith AP Photo Eric Dunn sit on the northern end of Tybee Island\u0027s beach watching larger than average waves roll in as a result of approaching Hurricane Matthew, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016 in Tybee Island, Ga. Hurricane Matthew was on track to rake Florida before spinning up the East Coast. The Category 4 storm packing winds of 145 mph pummeled parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday and is expected to head north over Cuba and the Bahamas before nearing the Florida coast by Thursday. Savannah Morning News via AP Josh Galemore Surf and wind from Hurricane Matthew crash on the waterfront in Baracoa, Cuba, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Ramon Espinosa AP Photo 1 of 4   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \nHurricane Matthew\u0027s slog toward the East Coast has government officials worried about complacency, especially in South Florida, which hasn\u0027t seen a major hurricane in 11 years. \nSouth Carolina\u0027s governor said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so that 1 million people would have time to leave the coast, and residents up and down the Eastern seaboard flocked to hardware stores, grocery aisles and gas stations to prepare for the powerful storm. \nPresently a dangerous Category 3 storm with top sustained winds of 125 mph, Matthew was churning toward the southeastern Bahamas early Wednesday amid predictions it would be very near Florida\u0027s Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. \nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said Matthew — recently a Category 4 storm and at one brief point a fierce Category 5 — will remain a powerful storm at least through Thursday night. It added that while maximum winds decreased slightly in recent hours, further fluctuations in intensity are possible in coming days. \nOfficials hope to avoid a repeat of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina, which caused major damage to South Florida in 2005, and Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, leveled much of the city of Homestead in 1992. The latter storm was on the minds of some officials Tuesday — both Miami-Dade County Commission Chairman Jean Monestime and U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo mistakenly called the current hurricane \"Andrew\" during a press conference, drawing nervous laughter. \nCurbelo, a Republican, said he wants assurances that the federal, state and local governments are working together. \n\"We just can\u0027t take it for granted that that\u0027s always going to happen,\" Curbelo said. \nThe Miami forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the area north of Golden Beach near Fort Lauderdale to Sebastian Inlet, meaning hurricane force winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within two days. A hurricane watch is in effect from Sebastian Inlet to the Daytona Beach area, meaning hurricane force winds could occur. \nDuring rush hour Tuesday, long lines formed at gas stations in Charleston, South Carolina, snarling traffic as lines snaked out of gas stations and into travel lanes. At one gas station in Mount Pleasant, the line reached about a quarter mile down the street. \nIn South Florida, lines at grocery stores were heavier than usual and some essentials were in short supply. When Simone Corrado and her husband tried to buy water at their Publix in Davie near Fort Lauderdale, they mostly found empty shelves. There were a few bottles of high-end water brands, but there was so much empty shelf space that Corrado lay down and fully stretched out on the bottom shelf. \n\"I got scared because all that was left at Publix was just the pricey water,\" said Corrado, who lived through 1992\u0027s catastrophic Hurricane Andrew, which practically leveled the nearby city of Homestead. \"They really put the fear into you here. On the television screen every few minutes is the \u0027beep, beep, beep\u0027 storm alert.\" \nGov. Rick Scott warned residents they must be prepared to take a direct hit and evacuation orders could be issued as early as Tuesday. \n\"Don\u0027t take a chance. Leave before it\u0027s too late,\" he said. \"We have to be prepared to be hit by a catastrophic hurricane.\" \nHurricane Hermine became the first to strike Florida since Wilma in 2005 when it hit the eastern Panhandle on Sept. 2 as a Category 1 storm, causing one death, storm surge damage to beachfront homes and downed trees and powerlines. That 11-year lull between storms hitting Florida was the longest on record. \nThe last storm to hit Florida from the Atlantic side was Katrina, which struck on its way to devastating the Gulf coast. \nWilma made landfall as a Category 3 storm with 120 mph winds, killing five people as it pushed from southwest Florida, through the Everglades and into the Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach area, causing an estimated $21 billion in damage and leaving thousands of residents without power for more than a week. It concluded a two-year span when a record eight hurricanes hit the state. \nGovernors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency, and the White House said President Barack Obama canceled a campaign and health care events in Florida on Wednesday and would instead visit the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an update. \nSome airlines let passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Matthew. \nNear Fort Lauderdale, The Home Depot in Davie briefly ran out of propane for gas barbecues and the supply of batteries was dwindling. People bought plywood to cover windows, tarps to put over outdoor furniture and coolers for food storage. \nAnesthesiologist Darby Lipka lugged a 20-pound propane tank across the parking lot, saying he had already purchased food and water. He installed hurricane windows years ago so he wouldn\u0027t need to erect shutters \n\"I am just trying to be prepared,\" he said. \nHaley said state officials would reverse lanes on major evacuation routes in South Carolina. It would be the first major evacuation since Hurricane Floyd in 1999, when the governor at the time didn\u0027t reverse the lanes and Interstate 26 became a parking lot. A typically two-hour drive from Charleston to Columbia turned into 24-hour nightmare. \n--- \nKay reported from Miami Beach.

      "text": "View Blog \nIt was just after midnight when Rebekah Dowell’s phone rang. It was her 14-year-old sister, Chloe, with panic in her voice, saying their mum Maria Smith and her partner Richard Lewis-Clements still weren’t home. \nThey had popped out in the car at 8.30pm to pick up something for dinner for her and their other sister Lucy, 18, and still hadn’t returned. photos: cocktail dresses uk \nA sense of dread pervaded Rebekah, 24, but it took an agonising two hours before her fears were confirmed by the police. \nBoth Maria, 48, and Richard, 46, were dead. They were killed instantly when their silver ­VW Polo was smashed into by a black SEAT Leon driven by Jodan Hunt at a junction near their home in Eastbourne, East Sussex. \nHunt, a 24-year-old builder, had been at a wedding reception at a hotel less than a mile away, and was 16 times over the drug-drive limit . \nBut rather than calling 999 for help, Hunt, unscathed, abandoned his car and fled the scene on foot, returning to the wedding. He was still at the nuptials when policetracked him down and arrested him. \nHe was jailed on September 1 after admitting two counts of causing death bydangerous driving . Justice should have provided some comfort for the devastated three sisters, but Hunt was sentenced to six years, which has left them devastated. \nThe maximum penalty for death by dangerous driving under the influence of drugs is 14 years. \n“As a family, we’re very angry,” says Rebekah, speaking for the first time since her mother’s death. \n“It’s essentially three years for each life he took away. How does that adequately reflect how dramatically this has changed our lives? \n“We’ve had ­everything taken away. Mum was like a best friend to my sisters Chloe, Lucy, and I. We were all so close – like a little unit – so it’s a huge blow to lose that.” \nRebekah, an events coordinator, still lived just 10 minutes away from her mum, and would regularly pop in for cups of tea and catch-ups. \nRecalling the night of the crash, she says: “When Chloe rang me around midnight to say they still weren’t home I could hear she was panicking. I told her to stay calm.” \nHer mind raced with possible ­explanations for where her mum and the man she regarded as her stepdad could be. \nShe continues: “Then, at 2am, Chloe called again to say the police were there, which must have been terrifying for her and Lucy. \n“I was told the police were bringing them to mine, but I wanted to know before they came what had happened, so I could prepare myself. \n“That’s when I was told there’d been a hit-and-run car crash and that neither mum nor Richard had survived. In that moment, my whole world came crashing down. I just had this feeling that nothing would ever be the same again. \n“Once the girls arrived at mine, we sat up together all night, trying to make sense of what had happened. It was surreal – that’s the only word I can use to describe it.” \nIt took just two-and-a-half hours after the crash for Hunt, a father of two, to be tracked down to the wedding reception and taken into custody. \nLiving in a small town, over the following days information was pieced together through word of mouth and local gossip. \n“A lot of people around were talking about the crash,” says Rebekah. \n“I remember when the police first told us they’d arrested a 24-year-old male and my heart just sank. \n“Eastbourne is a small place, so it was very likely I’d know him. \n“Sadly, I do. Though I’ve never met Jodan, I know of him and I have to say, I’m not surprised he’d do something like this.” \nFor Richard and Maria’s families, another devastating blow soon followed when they learned that Hunt had been 16 times over the legal drug- driving limit when he got behind the wheel. \nenzoylecgonine, the major metabolite of cocaine , was detected coursing through his system. \nTests after the crash found 800mcg of the substance per litre in his blood. The limit is 50mcg. \n“In my mind, there’s not a huge line between what he did and manslaughter,” says Rebekah. \n“He knew the risks and got behind the wheel anyway, with absolutely no regard for anybody else. A car is a weapon at the end of the day.” \nGuildford Crown Court heard how dad-of-two Hunt had sped through a pedestrian crossing on the wrong side of the road, before weaving through anti-terror barriers, which had been erected ahead of the resort’s annual Airbourne airshow. \nHe’d then clipped the kerb and skidded into the path of Richard and Maria’s car, causing unthinkable carnage and brutally ending their lives.",

      "title": "Selling uniforms for food, Venezuela oil workers feel the pinch",
      "text": "Selling uniforms for food, Venezuela oil workers feel the pinch 35 Mins Ago SHARES Carlos Garcia Rawlins | Reuters A worker walks past a mural with a PDVSA logo at its gas station in Caracas, Venezuela, August 29, 2014. \nFor decades, jobs at Venezuela\u0027s state-run oil giant PDVSA were coveted for above average salaries, generous benefits and cheap credit that brought home ownership and vacationing abroad within reach for many workers. \nNow, in Venezuela\u0027s asphyxiating economy, even PDVSA employees are struggling to pay for everything from food and bus rides to school fees as triple-digit inflation eats away incomes. \nThey are pawning goods, maxing out credit cards, taking side jobs, and even selling PDVSA uniforms to buy food, according to Reuters\u0027 interviews with two dozen workers, family members, and union leaders. \n\"Every day a PDVSA worker comes to sell his overall,\" said Elmer, a hawker at the biggest market in the oil city of Maracaibo, as shoppers eyed pricey rice and flour imported from neighboring Colombia. \n\"They also sell boots, trousers, gloves and masks.\" \nThe bulk of PDVSA\u0027s roughly 150,000 workers make from $35 to $150 a month plus some $90 dollars in food tickets, as calculated at the black market exchange rate. It is still more than many Venezuelans, but not enough, employees say. \n\"Sometimes we let the kids sleep in until noon to save on breakfast,\" said a maintenance worker who works on the shores of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela\u0027s traditional oil-producing area near the Colombian border. He said he has lost five kilos (11 lb) this year because of scrimping on food. \nThe toll of the economic crisis is fueling worker disillusionment, absenteeism, and a brain drain and is hurting efficiency in the industry which produces more than 90 percent of Venezuela\u0027s export revenue. \n\"Most of us aren\u0027t as productive as we used to be, because we\u0027re more focused on how to survive economically,\" said the maintenance worker, speaking on condition of anonymity as he said he feared reprisals. \nThat adds to a wide array of problems caused by a cash shortfall - from underinvestment and part shortages to poor maintenance, theft and insufficient imports for blending. \nAs a result, the OPEC member\u0027s oil output tumbled this year, dealing another blow to the unpopular government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, already under pressure due to low international oil prices. \nPDVSA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this story, says its employees are happy and state television regularly shows crowds of cheering PDVSA workers in red overalls. The company talks of a right-wing media campaign to discredit late leader Hugo Chavez\u0027s \"21st century Socialism.\" \n\"While PDVSA does not escape the (oil) price situation, its workforce remains intact and ready to generate initiatives to boost major projects,\" it said recently. Bartering to eat show chapters \u003cp\u003eVenezuela says oil supply exceeds demand\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOil prices are in the red after the country\u0026#039;s oil minister said global supplies must drop by at least 9-million barrels to match consumption.\u003c/p\u003e Tuesday, 20 Sep 2016 | 6:57 AM ET | 00:35 \nIn Ciudad Ojeda, a hot oil town that hugs the shores of Lake Maracaibo, food lines and shuttered shops dot the city of roughly 92,000 and, for the first time, the opposition-led mayor\u0027s office is organizing soup kitchens. \nA former PDVSA worker, who quit earlier this year because he could earn more driving a taxi, said that over the past months he sold four overalls and one pair of boots to feed his three children. He bartered another pair of boots for meat. He also sold his furniture, including his dining table, to buy food. \nFurther north at the massive Paraguana refining center, a mechanic and a father of two, recently offloaded new boots for roughly $7 - \"cheap, so I could sell quickly and get food.\" \nDespite their anger, workers say they are scared to protest. \nSince Chavez opponents tried to oust him by shutting down the oil industry in a months-long strike that started in 2002, stoppages are considered sabotage. \nOil workers duck out of work to stand in food lines, and people at the Petrocedeno oil upgrader in eastern Venezuela say rowdy company cafeteria queues now start an hour before lunch as workers jostle before food runs out. \nMaduro blames these shortages on U.S.-backed businessmen he says are hoarding products to torpedo his government, an argument that still resounds with some workers. \n\"The situation is tough because of the \u0027economic war\u0027,\" said PDVSA cook Moraima Reyes in Paraguana. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re defending the revolution more than ever.\" \nBut many speak of leaving PDVSA or Venezuela altogether, joining a brain drain that has seen professionals flock to Colombia, Spain or Panama. \n\"What\u0027s the point of working? It\u0027s impossible to have a good quality of life,\" a former automation specialist at PDVSA said in a phone interview. Last year he moved to the United States, where he has to hold several jobs, including in a restaurant and a car dealership. \n\"I have no regrets. Whatever it takes to escape Venezuela\u0027s communism.\" SHOW COMMENTS",

(AP) - Testimony is scheduled to resume in the trial of a Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside a hot SUV. \nThe trial of Justin Ross Harris enters its third day Wednesday in coastal Brunswick, where the case was moved 275 miles from the Atlanta suburbs because of pretrial publicity. \nProsecutors say Harris intentionally killed his 22-month-old son, Cooper, by leaving the child for seven hours in a vehicle parked outside the father\u0027s Cobb County workplace. \nHarris\u0027 defense lawyer Maddox Kilgore told the jury in his opening statement Tuesday that Harris is certainly responsible for his son\u0027s death, but insisted it was an accident and Harris committed no crime. \nThe trial of Harris, who moved to Georgia from Alabama in 2012, is expected to last several weeks.

      "text": "(Reuters) - A Georgia man accidentally left his toddler son to die in a hot car in 2014 but did not kill him intentionally in order to pursue online sex as prosecutors contend, his defense lawyer argued on Tuesday. Justin Harris, 35, could be sentenced to life in prison if jurors find he meant to leave his 22-month-old son, Cooper, to die in a locked SUV outside his workplace in suburban Atlanta for seven hours on a sweltering day.Harris drove straight to work with the child strapped in the back seat after they had a father-son breakfast at a Chick-fil-A, forgetting to take the child to daycare, the lawyer said.Whatever the father\u0027s sexual appetites, \"That has nothing to do with what happened to that little boy,\" defense attorney Maddox Kilgore told the jury in opening arguments of the murder trial.After prosecutors portrayed Harris as a man obsessed with having sex with prostitutes and other women and texting to teenagers, Kilgore said he was a God-fearing man who was broken over the death of his son, knowing that he was responsible.\"Responsible isn\u0027t the same as criminal. It was an accident,\" Kilgore said.Whatever his client\u0027s \"sexual sins ... no matter how perverse and nasty, has nothing to do with what happened to that little boy,\" Kilgore said.The lawyer said his client\u0027s grief over the death of his son was plainly evident, contradicting prosecutors\u0027 claim he shed no tears.\"He wept bitterly outside the view of the police, and he cried out to God in disbelief for what he has done,\" Kilgore said.Harris faces a host of charges including murder and sending sexually explicit text messages to underage women.Prosecutors on Monday had told the jury Harris led a \"double life of deception\" who played the role of loyal husband and doting father while also exchanging nude photos online and planning to kill his child so he could move on to a new life.",

      "text": "I\u0027ve had a few recent rentals and can also concur some of the notes mentioned. What I really like about the Now app is the access to \u0027real-time\u0027 inventory. Let me mention a few tips and what I think is a bug that has happened to me twice. I am a Preferred Plus renter currently.\nAt some point before your reserved time, this Avis system will assign a car to you automatically. If you try to use the app before that, it is not very useful and I also was asked to pay to switch rented classes even though it seemed pretty clear there was no car available in my booked class. Usually a car is assigned sometime between 30 and 15 minutes before your rental time unless there is a really bad inventory issue.\nOnce a car is assigned, then, there is a lot more flexibility to get complimentary exchanges with less regard to booked/paid class. In my case, I booked intermediate and got a mini-van assigned. I looked at the options to switch/exchange a few times on my way over to the Preferred area and on my last check, I was finally offered a very low mileage 2017 vehicle midsize SUV which I selected. I did even see the assignment board change the stall number (from the minivan). The key aspect here is you do not have to ask a rep about car options. I still wish it would give me a lot more options than it was doing (only offered me two exchange choices at a time).\nNow the bug I have experienced on two different rentals is that my FF partner number drops off each time I switch the car on the app. The reason why I know this is because my total decreased by a bit more than a $1 per day for my planed rental (the FF/points Avis fee). I had to stop and see an agent before I drove the car to add back the FF id to get my total back to the right amount and before driving the car. I am not sure if others have seen this issue.\nRasheed",
