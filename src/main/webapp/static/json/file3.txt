      "text": "I saw the #firstfiver campaign on Twitter last month, where everyone is encouraged to give the first new design five pound note to charity and thought, it was a really nice idea. \n\nEarlier this week I got my first fiver (the change from a lovely jacket potato at independent Newcastle sandwich bar Hippo House ) and wondered who to give it to?\n\nWell, the easy decision was St Oswald’s Children’s Hospice who NBS are currently supporting as part of the Newcastle Snow Dogs initiative . Our snow dog was painted by Newcastle College - black and white - and called WorGeordie . \nLots of fund raising activities are planned over the next few months - but nice to be able to give my #firstfiver to a good cause. \nSome Snow Dog photographs from lunchtime walk around the Quayside and then evening walk up to Newcastle University and back... Arriving into Central Station - On the right in the distance is the \u0027New castle\u0027 Our very own Wor Geordie Snow Dog with our Old Post Office building in the background \nThree snow dogs on display in the Sage Gateshead with RIBA Sterling Prize winning Millennium Bridge in the background \nOutside of the Sage Gateshead Pitcher and Piano pub with Tyne Bridge in the background Newcastle Eldon Square shopping centre The beautiful Theatre Royal on Grey Street Looking up Grey Street to Central Arcade, Greys Monument and the Monument Mall So, if you are wondering what to do with your first fiver - then maybe a donation to one of your local charities would be a nice touch.",

      "text": "Chery Mills is using corrupt means to protect criminal Hillary Clinton from the rule of law and the FBI was destroyed by the Clinton crime Foundation which controls the US State Department employees that use hammers to crush Hillary secret BlackberryÂs. Shame on America for letting the Clinton Crime Foundation bribe to Comey and making FBI look like a joke. The NY Times get millions of untaxed dollars from the corrupt Clinton Foundation which does not pay 700 million dollar Federal taxes on two billion dollars that Hillary got in pay for Play treason money from our worst enemies because it was falsely registered by the Clinton Crime family as charity institution. The Clinton Foundation of crime represents billions of dollars of evil radical global political power of corruption which collects money from the worst enemies of America that seek Death to America, but it was used to bribe FBI Chief Comey with 6 million dollars to protect Hillary from standing to trail for her crimes but yet Hillary does not pay taxes because she falsely registered the Clinton Foundation as Charity non- profit Foundation which is false when only 10% goes to Charity and the other 90% is in the Clintons pockets As political tool rather than a fake charity foundation of lies, the Clintons avoided paying taxes and enrich the Clintons Crime Family and mafia as major political financing power of more than two billion dollars which is used to control the media, buy illegal votes with money and to go as a dog attack machine after the enemies of Hillary and the Democratic party and paying NY Times to use hundreds of people to investigate anything about Trump. Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation of crimes represent evil warmonger and ugly woman who collaborated with the worst powers of evil in the Middle East including the Iranian regime that seek holocaust of the Jews and others and the ISIS Caliphate of murderous Mozlem Brother terrorists that never had a c caliphate before Hillary removed US troops from the Middle east and armed ISIS caliphate with area larger than Great Britain with American best weapons including tanks, artillery, Missiles and Humvees along the borders of Israel while support their agenda to build ISIS caliphate center in Jerusalem. The Iranian regime did not have any nukes until Hillary and Bill Clinton worked hard to bring Uranium to the Iranian-Russian partnership in nukes from America and Kazakhstan together with 20,000 centrifuges to enrich Uranium in Iranian underground secret sites away from the UN watchdog while Hillary allowed the Iranian regime to inspect the nuke sites by itself. Hillary is evil warmonger and a corrupt America hater woman who collaborated with evil terrorists of al Qaida in Libya and armed them to kill Gaddafi in cold blood while she send cruise missiles to kill tens of thousands of innocent Libyans. Hillary is an evil warmonger criminal who used our CIA in Benghazi to transfer weapons from the weapon cache of Gaddafi to Gaza and Sinai and in addition to terrorist organizations in Syria that stated the Rebel war against Syrian president Assad. Hillary is an evil warmonger who caused the death of more than 500,000 innocent women, men and children in Syria and destroying the homes of more than 15 million innocent people who became refugees that Hillary bringing to America and to Europe together with thousands of ISIS terrorists. From her first day in the White House Hillary was engaged with illegal secret e-mail server hidden in remote area in Colorado mountain knowing that she must hide her evil warmongering actions against America and Israel and being able to erase all the tens of thousands of e-mails that proved her actions against America while the top secrets were hacked and stolen by the Russian-Iranian nuke partnership leading to the death of at least one intelligence agent of America that his identity was uncovered by Hillary reckless e-mails.",

      "text": "\nBut at other points he showed a deftness that Mr. Trump often lacked at his own debate last week. And he also offered voters a face of the Republican Party that was not overly dark or angry, as Mr. Trump has often been in this race.\nContinue reading the main story \n“Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign,” Mr. Pence said. “The campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.”\nFrom Mr. Trump’s proposals for cutting taxes and repealing the Affordable Care Act to “ending the war on coal,” a phrase he repeated several times, Mr. Pence tried to describe Mr. Trump’s views in ways intended to energize social conservatives, working-class white voters and other Republicans while delivering a measured performance that might appeal to undecided voters who are wary of Mr. Trump’s fiery and unpredictable temperament.\nNeither candidate made significant errors through the night, meeting the baseline test of not doing any harm to the top of the ticket. Of the two, Mr. Kaine appeared far different from his usual self: He has been a more mellow debater in the past, a sign that the Clinton campaign trained him to be an attack dog on Tuesday.\nMr. Pence had his strongest moments during a lengthy exchange over abortion rights, as he excoriated Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine for supporting laws that allowed what opponents call “partial-birth abortions.” He also argued that Mr. Kaine, a Catholic who personally opposes abortion, had bent his own views to support Mrs. Clinton’s positions on abortion.\nKaine and Pence’s Debate: Analysis We analyzed the only vice-presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence in real time. \n\n“The very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me,” Mr. Pence said.\nBut Mr. Kaine, who rarely if ever ceded a debating point through the 90-minute event, insisted that a candidate’s faith should not dictate policy. “The very last thing the government should do is punish women who make reproductive choices,” referring to a comment that Mr. Trump made on MSNBC months ago.\n“Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that would punish women who made the heartbreaking choice,” Mr. Pence said. When Mr. Kaine reminded Mr. Pence of Mr. Trump’s statement to the contrary, Mr. Pence stammered.\n“Look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton,” he said.\nMr. Pence alternated between ignoring Mr. Trump’s inflammatory comments and making it clear that he had a different view on some issues. He repeatedly offered tough talk about Vladimir V. Putin’s government in Moscow, for example, even though Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised the Russian leader.\nContinue reading the main story \n“The Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates,” Mr. Pence said, evoking Reagan-era imagery. At another moment, Mr. Pence called Mr. Putin a “small and bullying leader.”\nMr. Kaine sought to box in the Republicans, saying, “You’ve got to be tough on Russia, so let’s start by not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.”\n“We haven’t,” Mr. Pence protested, even though he himself said on CNN last month that Mr. Putin was “a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.” But Mr. Pence during the debate flatly denied making that remark.\nMr. Pence’s refusal to justify or explain Mr. Trump’s past remarks in any detail drew withering fire from Mr. Kaine.\n“Six times tonight I have said to Governor Pence, I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next, and in all six cases he’s refused to defend his running mate,” Mr. Kaine said.\nFact Checks of the Vice-Presidential Debate Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Senator Tim Kaine and Gov. Mike Pence during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. \n\n“I’m happy to defend him,” Mr. Pence said, but then spent more time assailing Mrs. Clinton over the civil war in Syria and the Iran nuclear deal.\nMr. Pence said “Oh, come on” and “Oh, that’s nonsense” over and over again, but that did not seem to halt Mr. Kaine’s steady assault on Mr. Trump. At one point Mr. Pence acknowledged that he was “just trying to keep up” with Mr. Kaine’s attacks, while the Democrat shot back that he was simply using Mr. Trump’s own words against the Republican ticket. At another point, when Mr. Kaine suggested that even Ronald Reagan would find Mr. Trump unacceptable, Mr. Pence seemed almost at a loss for words.\n“Senator, that was even beneath and you and Hillary Clinton — and that’s pretty low,” Mr. Pence said.\nContinue reading the main story \nAnd when Mr. Kaine, for a fourth time, brought up Mr. Trump’s assertion in his presidential announcement speech last year that Mexican migrants are “criminals and rapists,” Mr. Pence flashed irritation. “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,” he said.\nMr. Kaine’s attempts to irk Mr. Pence emphasized how the Democratic ticket is determined to use the debates to inflict maximum damage on Mr. Trump by reminding voters of his divisive and even racist language and views over the years.\nMr. Trump, after a strong few weeks in September, has been struggling in the polls and on the campaign trail since his first debate last week, and Mrs. Clinton hopes to capitalize on his troubles with a series of stinging attacks in their two remaining debates.\nMr. Pence, for his part, has dutifully attacked Mrs. Clinton’s record and played down Mr. Trump’s rhetorical excesses, but he is also widely expected to seek office again if Republicans lose this year. He was therefore caught in a dilemma Tuesday, forced to choose between being unblinkingly loyal to the man who elevated him to national prominence and handing fodder to rivals in a potential future race.\nIn one of several moments when the candidates tried to appeal to their own distinct voting blocs, Mr. Pence attempted to drive a wedge between the Democrats’ African-American base and up-for-grabs white voters, targeting Mrs. Clinton for what he said was her practice of “bad-mouthing cops.”\n“Enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly,” Mr. Pence said.\nMr. Kaine argued that there is “implicit bias” in policing, a phrase Mrs. Clinton has echoed from the Black Lives Matter movement.\nWhile vice-presidential candidates use their debates to promote and defend their running mates, Mr. Pence had the heavier political burden on Tuesday after a weeklong barrage of outbursts from Mr. Trump that renewed questions about his temperament and his ability to win in November.\nMr. Kaine aimed his political message squarely at minorities by regularly mentioning Mr. Trump’s attacks on Hispanics and illegal immigrants, and at women by noting Mr. Trump’s recent insults against a former Miss Universe who had gained weight soon after winning the pageant. Mr. Kaine argued that Mr. Trump was incapable of expressing regret or admitting he was wrong, which he described as dubious traits for a president.\nContinue reading the main story \n“Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?” Mr. Kaine said. “Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?”\nMr. Pence sought to deflect questions about Mr. Trump’s failure to release his tax returns by noting how many jobs the hotel developer had created, and he defended Mr. Trump’s use of the tax code to claim a $916 million loss that may have helped him avoid paying federal income taxes for nearly 20 years.\n“Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician,” Mr. Pence said. “Those tax returns showed that he faced some pretty tough times.”\n“But why won’t he release his tax returns?” Mr. Kaine said interjected.\nThe moderator, Elaine Quijano of CBS News, lost control of the debate at several points as Mr. Kaine trampled on Mr. Pence’s two-minute answers.\nMr. Kaine used a discussion of foreign policy to unleash a torrent of attacks on Mr. Trump for his breezy comments on nuclear weapons and praise for a series of authoritarian strongmen.\n“He loves dictators, he’s got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore,” said the senator, citing leaders like Mr. Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\nMr. Pence sidestepped Mr. Kaine’s criticism, instead mocking his rival for lobbing a rehearsed attack. “Did you work on that one a long time?” Mr. Pence deadpanned.\n“Let’s see if you can defend any of it,” Mr. Kaine shot back.\nBut Mr. Pence made no real attempt to do so.\nThe next debate, on Sunday, will feature Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in a town meeting format where voters will ask questions. The third presidential debate will be on Oct. 19.\nContinue reading the main story \n\n\nSource link \n",

      "text": "  Blind man criticises Cirencester Town Council following decision to switch off crossing in Market Place The push button crossing on West Market Place 0 comments \nA BLIND man has criticised Cirencester Town Council (CTC) for switching off a push button crossing in Market Place, but the authority says the decision was taken after consulting the visually impaired community. \nBill Waddell, from Gloucester, a member of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), called CTC’s decision to switch off the crossing next to the Parish Church at West Market Place, as part of an 18-month trial, a ‘mistake’. \nOn the underside of push button panels there is a small rotating cone, which starts turning when the green man is displayed on the traffic light and is a signal to visually impaired pedestrians that it is safe to cross the road. \n“Taking away the push button crossings, which are the only sure way blind people can tell that a vehicle has stopped for them to cross the road safely is a mistake,” said Mr Waddell, who regularly visited Cirencester before he lost his sight. \nHe said he contacted Andrew Tubb , CTC chief executive, to complain about the issue and was told that the switching off of the push button system was part of an extended trial, with the plan to introduce zebra crossings in West Market Place and Castle Street. \nA spokeswoman for CTC said: “After extensive public consultation over an extended period of several years and consultation with disability access groups, including those representing the visually impaired and blind, the conclusion was to install two zebra crossings with Belisha beacons, one in West Market Place and one in Castle Street. \n“The final consultation at which this decision was made was at a meeting held with Guide Dogs for the Blind on behalf of the Guide Dogs and RNIB as well as representatives from local access groups.” \n“They all supported Belisha beacon zebra crossings,” she added, going on to say that: “This was then incorporated into the planning application that was granted consent in December 2014 and into the Highway Agreement required by Gloucestershire County Council ( GCC ) in early 2016.” \nShe added: “The removal of the traffic signals is part of an extended trial that is a requirement of GCC. \n“The trial will run for a period of 18 months following completion of the works in November 2016.” \nHowever, Mr Waddell said that while zebra crossings ‘may help blind guide dog users’ – those ‘who use a long white cane will not be able to see if a car has stopped.’ \nHe said: “Listening to hear if a car has stopped is very difficult in noisy conditions and now silent electric cars are becoming popular it will become more dangerous.”",

      "text": "Tell a friend A letter from former parks superintendent Chris Williams to COLA on addendum items \nDear Cole, Thank you for the opportunity to meet with you a few days ago. Jesús and I left the meeting feeling as though we had made a breakthrough in moving our organizations closer to a shared vision for the future of off-leash areas in Seattle. During the meeting, we reaffirmed the department’s commitment to off-leash areas as a legitimate and desired recreational use of park land, similar to other active uses like athletic fields. We expressed a deep desire and commitment to work with COLA, especially to ensure that the strategic plan reflects to the extent possible the interests of off-leash area users and doing so in a way that avoids conflicts with non-users. In our view, another purpose for meeting with you was to begin, in earnest, a process to build trust and strengthen our partnership toward a shared vision of making our off-leash areas the best dog parks they can be. While we may not always be able to agree on the best way forward, we hope to establish a foundation of trust and a mutual understanding that the partnership is always moving toward better off-leash areas. We need your help now and in the future to help communicate with the wider off-leash community about various challenges and opportunities. We have reviewed the most recent letter from COLA in which you enumerate specific concerns, and list changes you would like to see in the strategic plan. It is worth pointing out, that in many areas where you have identified a need for change, the strategic plan is actually much closer to meeting your stated goals; however, we recognize some of these sections of the plan could be re-written to be more clear. We support your summary of the meeting and offer additional language to clarify our position on key issues. We agree to: 1) Clarify language in the draft plan to more clearly expresses departmental support for off-leash areas. 2) Modify language in the plan to be more clear that we are fully committed to take an opportunistic approach to acquiring new land for off-leash areas. 3) As our funding situation improves, we will be committed to a more strategic approach to acquiring new off-leash areas. 4) Designate a staff person to be the department lead on off-leash areas and serve as liaison with COLA. 5) Support the concept of pilot sites with the understanding that we can only support fenced areas. 6) Vet proposals for pilot sites through our normal community engagement process, including with the ad-hoc committee described in the draft plan. We will work closely with you once these sites have been identified. 7) Maintain non Park-owned off- leash sites assuming we are funded to do so. 8) Confirm that insurance is a non-issue, as the City is self-insured. Moreover, we couldn’t think of a scario where we would ever ask volunteers and/or off-leash area users to provide insurance. 9) Support all efforts by COLA to engage in fundraising and grant writing for off-leash areas. 10) Include a public engagement process in the development of 3 or 4 pilot sites, per the public engagement process outlined in the draft strategic plan: Hubbard Homestead Park, Stone Way at 125th, Maple Leaf Reservoir and Adams Street Boat Ramp. 11) Support your recommendation to modify the equipment list and reprioritize the current list of maintenance items. 12) Generally agree that more water access is desirable for dog parks, and given that desire, agree that more work is required to develop standards for water access, including public health standards, accessibility, fencing, safety, etc. In nearly all cases where shoreline access is considered, we would need approval from a regulatory agency. 13) Recommend regular meetings/check-ins between the department and COLA at the leadership level to build on our recent communication. Please let me know if you have questions and thank you for your continued partnership. Sincerely, Christopher Williams Residents on both sides of the fence came out last month to tell the Seattle Parks Board what they think of the draft master plan for off-leash areas, with dog owners barking loudest during a two-hour public hearing. Many dog owners and canine-centric business owners complained that the plan lacks a commitment to any pilots or other programs, seemingly making due with the annual $104,000 budgeted to Seattle Parks and Recreation for maintaining the city’s 14 current OLAs and making improvements where possible. SPR superintendent Jesús Aguirre said the Seattle City Council directed the parks department to work with the Coalition for Off-Leash Areas to improve the plan prior to the Sept. 22 meeting. COLA executive director Cole Eckerman gave a brief description of the addendum to the plan the group and SPR agreed upon prior to public comment. That includes clarifying language in the draft plan regarding SPR’s support for OLAs and also its commitment to seeking new land for off-leash areas, should funding improve. Aguirre said another change made in June was to have a single point-of-contact within SPR for OLAs. Pilot sites will be supported under the addendum, but only in fenced areas. A number of Seattle residents commented last Thursday that SPR should consider off-leash hours at parks, especially neighborhoods far from one of the city’s 14 OLAs, which range from 28 acres in Magnuson Park to one-tenth of an acre at Kinnear Park. An ad-hoc committee described in the draft plan would vet pilot proposals. Aguirre said SPR does not support letting dogs off-leash in unfenced areas of public lands due to issues surrounding enforcement and potential conflicts. Wallingford resident Emily Friedman said she felt ideas about designated off-leash hours in parks was dismissed without thorough research, adding of a Volunteer Park pilot in 1997 that the public space was much different then. Friedman said it’s insulting to suggest small and large dogs shouldn’t mix. Another part of the addendum would include a public engagement process for the development of up to four pilot sites for off-leash areas, which Aguirre said would take significant community outreach to identify target sites in each city council district. “Together, COLA and Seattle Parks and Recreation can build an equitable OLA system that is easily accessible to every dog owner in their local community,” Eckerman said. “We can only achieve this though if we have adequate funding and more strategic, objective and measurable approaches to land uses.” Eckerman said COLA is also drafting grant applications to fund a feasibility study before OLAs policies are formally adopted. Aguirre said he believes the revisions under the addendum will have a significant impact on the plan as a whole. Many proponents of increasing accessibility and the number of OLAs in Seattle wanted to see more water access for their dogs, which would be supported under the addendum, but Aguirre cautioned state regulatory agencies control shorelines, so such decisions would not fall squarely on Parks and Recreation. While dog owners were plentiful at the Sept. 22 meeting, there was also a contingent of Seattle residents that did not want to see canines take precedence over people at city parks. “This meeting seems to be rather a love fest for COLA and for dogs,” said Eliza Davidson, who is also a member of the Volunteer Park Trust. One OLA in Volunteer Park east of the Seattle Asian Art Museum drew complaints from 15th Avenue East neighbors regarding dog feces not being picked up and noise. The OLA was relocated, but was later shut down by a court order due to Parks and Recreation not subjecting the property to a State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) review. Davidson said she likes dogs, but chooses not to own one. She said parks space should not be taken away and given to dogs and their owners, which was met with heckling that had to be tempered by parks board chairman Tom Boyers. Deborah Niedermeyer said there needs to be better enforcement when it comes to people letting their dogs off-leash in parks where it is prohibited, as those dogs sometimes cause confrontations with dog owners who have their pets on a leash. “I won’t let my dog off leash,” she said, “that’s illegal.” Queen Anne resident Mark McDuff said he’s tired of driving 2,500 miles per year to take his dog to an off-leash area, because none are close to him, passing many parks he can’t use. “I’m tired of hearing dogs don’t pay taxes,” McDuff said. “Well, neither do basketballs, but that doesn’t stop us from building basketball courts.” Justin Green said he’s seen damage caused in park planting areas by dogs allowed off leash. If SPR is lacking funds, he suggested more enforcement of dogs without city licenses and charging fees for using OLAs. There are 39,000 licensed canines in Seattle, and Aguirre said it’s obvious there are many more dogs than that living in the city. Having people license their pets would provide better data for SPR to use in making decisions, he added. According to COLA, there are 1.5 dogs for every child in Seattle, which is roughly around 150,000 canines. Alan Deright said that’s where SPR should get its funding, from fining owners of unlicensed dogs. But he doesn’t support OLAs, he said, adding he was very happy to see them disappear from Volunteer Park. “Off-leash areas are in my basket of deplorables,” Deright said. Those same sentiments were shared by Ellen Taft, who heads up the Citizens for the Protection of Volunteer Park group. She said she’d rather see money spent on drug rehabilitation, the homeless, daycare for children and activities for at-risk youth. Jessie Dye said both of her dogs are licensed, but she’s going to continue letting them run off leash in city parks until something is done about the shortage of OLAs in Seattle. She also said more beach access is needed for dogs. Ellen Escarega, who chairs the COLA board, said the all-volunteer organization is just looking for legal ways to represent the one-in-four Seattle households containing dogs. “We’re not entitled,” she said. “We’re lacking legal land.” Capitol Hill resident David DiMarco said if there are more dogs than children, maybe parks should be turned over to canines and OLAs reserved for the children, a rather “dystopian idea,” he admitted, but he feels like he’s “living in a dystopian city.” Capitol Hill has two options for OLAs, one being I-5 Colonnade Park and the other Plymouth Pillars Park, which DiMarco called a “gravel urine receptor.” There will be no other public hearings on the matter, and recommendations from the Seattle Parks Board are expected to come down in November.

      "text": "Stressed Out by US Election? Tune Out and Assume Downward-facing Dog Pose - Argentina Star \nEdition 279/2016 Stressed Out by US Election? Tune Out and Assume Downward-facing Dog Pose \nVOA Wednesday 5th October, 2016 \nStop reading the news and take up yoga. That\u0027s what some therapists in the United States are telling patients stressed out by a nasty presidential campaign in which two unpopular candidates are in a tight race for the most powerful office in the world. \nWhile some patients are unhappy with the idea of a Hillary Clinton presidency, most are worried about Donald Trump, a blunt-spoken, insult-spewing New York businessman who has never held public office, according to interviews with seven therapists across six states and the District of Columbia. \nThe therapists said their patients have complained of difficulty sleeping, irritability and heart palpitations. They said they were advising clients to limit exposure to the news and take up breathing exercises and yoga to calm down. \n\u0027I\u0027ve never seen this level of stress and anxiety over an impending election in my 26 years [of practicing],\u0027 said Nancy Molitor, a clinical psychologist from just outside Chicago. \nMolitor said she had two elderly patients who were worried that their grandchildren would inherit an America in turmoil. \nAnother, a World War II veteran, sees similarities between Trump and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Molitor added. \nClinton has accused Trump of racism and sexism, and her campaign frequently calls him \u0027unhinged\u0027 and unfit for the presidency, saying he has a volatile temperament that could endanger U.S. national security. Trump, in turn, has said Clinton is a corrupt life-long politician who should be jailed for her use of a private email server without official approval while she was secretary of state. \n\u0027Sense of control is gone\u0027 \nPhilip Muskin, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and scientific program chair of the American Psychiatric Association, said the anxiety among his patients reminded him of the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks, and the crashing to Earth of America\u0027s first space station, Skylab, in 1979, which had people around the world worried they could be hit by falling space debris. \n\u0027For everybody, the sense of control is gone,\u0027 Muskin said. \nAdding to the anxiety is the fact that the two candidates in the Nov. 8 election are the most unpopular in modern U.S. history. Some 57.5 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, and nearly 54 percent have an unfavorable view of Clinton, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. \nThere is no data available to quantify the election-related anxiety, but the therapists\u0027 anecdotes give some insight into the state of the national psyche. \nElaine Ducharme, a clinical psychologist from Glastonbury, Connecticut, said the election was also on the minds of all of her patients. \u0027I can\u0027t think of a person I\u0027ve talked to [who] does not feel anxious about this,\u0027 she said. \nTherapists, themselves, aren\u0027t immune to these anxieties. \n\u0027I can\u0027t say to my patients, \u0027Oh my God, it\u0027s making me a wreck,\u0027 but I can sit and empathize,\u0027 Ducharme said \nTurn off, tune out \nLynn Bufka, executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, said one patient was concerned that much of the criticism of Clinton was just because she was a woman, and this had affected how the patient viewed herself. \n\u0027What does this mean for her as a woman? Have things really changed that much for her in terms of what she can do?\u0027 Bufka recalled the patient wondering. \nTrump has said Clinton, who would be America\u0027s first female president, lacks a \u0027presidential look\u0027 and has called other female critics \u0027fat,\u0027 \u0027pig,\u0027 or \u0027bimbo.\u0027 \nBufka said Latino and Muslim patients are also anxious about Trump\u0027s proposals to build a wall along the Mexican border and to temporarily suspend immigration by Muslims. \nHer advice: \u0027Turn off the news feed. Stop reading everything if it just gets you more stressed.\u0027 Share this article:",

Mindy Kaling is starring in \u0027Ocean\u0027s Eight\u0027 \n“Look, I’m real scared, man, because when I look at that list of people, I know that my skill is going to be I get attacked by the guard dog so they can break into the casino,” Kaling confessed. \nMore: Rihanna set to join ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ all-female spin-off movie \nThe 37 year old star also revealed that Ocean’s Eight would be taking place in New York City, rather than Las Vegas, and would contain “a fashion element” to the plotline. \nColbert then asked her whether they’d be needing any male extras for the movie. “Oh, that would be great,” Kaling said. “We’re gonna rob your house, is that OK? Me and Cate Blanchett.” \n“You and Cate Blanchett can do whatever you want,” Colbert responded wryly. \nKaling was speaking on the same day that ‘The Mindy Project’ returned to its current home on Hulu for its fifth season. In an interview with Glamour magazine the day before its premiere, she said that she was confident that fans would enjoy the new series. \n“I think they will be surprised and feel really satisfied. In fact, our creative executive at Hulu just saw the premiere and was like, ‘Oh my God, I love the ending.’ It’s an ending I’m really proud of. I think people are going to like it.”",

      "text": "\nMost people never think too much about their back doors or their patio doors, but often these doors are used more often than other doors in the home and are of course very important. \n\nYour patio door often leads out to family fun and in some cases, backyard parties. These doors often get more traffic and are also abused in a way. Consider all the times, you have heard the door slam, the dog scratching at the interior of the door to go outside and then the exterior to come indoors, and of course the kids coming in and out all day long on nice days. Then comes the summer when family and friends enjoy cook outs or using your swimming pool. How many times a day is your patio door opened and closed? \n\nHow long has it been since you took a good look at your back patio door? Is it worn, are there panes that are cracked, is the glass broken, or do you notice all the blemishes from the dog and of course the weather? If so, it may be time to consider a new patio door. \n\nAnother thing to consider with your patio door is that often this is the door that burglars use to enter your home. Since this is the door that is often neglected, robbers know they can easily enter your home often with just a small push. If you have any broken glass it will be even easier to enter your home. \n\nWhen you decide to purchase a new patio door it is best to speak with an expert as they will able to help you choose a door that will be able to withstand the abuse as well as the weather. You can ask questions which will help you make an educated decision. If you have a pet that scratches the door, you should ask if they have any suggestions so that the wood on the door would not be damaged or what other choices you have besides wood. Of course, you will also want to ensure that the door you choose will be able to withstand all the traffic as well as keep out a burglar. The problem often comes in when choosing patio doors in Toronto is that you want a nice looking door that will enhance the look of your patio as well as compliment the rest of your home but provide as much protection as possible. The good news is that you have all kinds of options on the market today instead of what you found a few years. Today, with the advancements in technology and all the new materials and designs in patio doors you are sure to find the perfect one to fit your requirements and will withstand your dog, your traffic, and the elements.",

Im voicing an experience I had with a particular breeder and you jump on my thread like a dog in heat. If you are such a seedsman flunky you would see on their site it says WE DO NOT CONSIDER OURSELVES TO BE BREEDERS, only to help other seedsbanks get ride of their stuff. Now why would they have that on their page and then still try breeding? Maybe you can answrr that quesion Mr seedsman dick rider. Click to expand... Seedsman sells other breeders seeds along with their own. It says it right on the site. You really don\u0027t k ow you\u0027re ass from a hole in the ground. I\u0027m guessing you had problems from a breeder other than seedsman. If so the fault is with the breeder not seedsman. Female seeds sell nothing but their own gear. You really do not know what you are talking about. Others will see this as well. I have always back up what I claim. Read the second sentence if the second paragraph. See where it says they sell their own seeds as well as others? Again. Lol.",

      "text": "Share on Reddit \nSPRAYING graffiti on a wall, insulting the king’s dog, photoshopping an image of the Lord Buddha, carrying plastic bags, or saying the word “bomb” at the airport are all crimes which can land you in a foreign prison. \nStripping down to Malaysian flag underwear in public has put nine Australian former private schoolboys in a Kuala Lumpur police cell, but they join a long list of people jailed overseas for “minor” offences. \nThe sentences for these crimes considered far more seriously abroad can mean months in the notoriously harsh prisons of Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia. \nIn countries like Malaysia and Singapore, the punishment can include a public caning by the feared “rattan”, or practice of caning. \nConservative standards of dress and behaviour apply in those and many other Asian countries. \nBut in Malaysia, crimes punishable by harsh sentences also include homosexual acts, which can incur a 20 year prison sentence and caning. Australian Jodi Magi was jailed in the UAE for posting a photo on Facebook she had taken of a car parked across two disabled parking spaces outside her Abu Dhabi apartment. Source: Supplied Sentenced to caning in Singapore, teenager Michael Fay was initially given four months prison and six strokes from the rattan for spray painting cars. Source: AP A variety of rattan canes can inflict unbelievable pain according to men whipped as part of their sentence. Picture: Wikimedia Commons Source: Supplied A figure made up to depict the practice of caning which is still imposed in Malaysia and Singapore for what may seem to be ‘minor’ offences. Picture: Wikimedia Commons Source: Supplied \nAustralians who have fallen foul of overseas laws include Jodi Magi, 39, jailed last year in the United Arab Emirates for posting a photo on Facebook she had taken of a car parked across two disabled parking spaces outside her Abu Dhabi apartment. \nFound guilty of “writing bad words on social media about a person”, Magi was thrown into jail before being deported from the UAE where she had been teaching graphic design. \nAnother Australian woman, Alicia Gali, was jailed for eight months in the UAE for “having an illicit sexual relationship” after she reported being drugged and raped by co-workers. \nSex outside marriage is also illegal in Jordan, where it is punishable by a maximum three years in prison. \nIn the Pacific Islands, you can be arrested for sodomy in Tonga and adultery in Papua New Guinea. \nIn Myanmar, for the crime of “insulting Buddha”, New Zealander Phil Blackwood spent 13 months in a windowless cell where the fluorescent lights were never turned off. \nBlackwood was arrested within 24 hours of posting on Facebook a photoshopped image of Buddha wearing headphones to promote cheap drinks at the V Gastro Bar he managed. It was this image of Buddha wearing headphone that landed Phil Blackwood in a Burmese prison for 13 months. Source: Supplied Nine Sydney university graduates and former private schoolboys are in a Malaysian police cell after stripping down to these budgie smugglers at the Kuala Lumpur Grand Prix. Picture: Ranes Subramaniam/Twitter Source: Twitter \nThrown into the notorious Insein Prison in the Myanmar capital Yangon, he lived with murderers and drug dealers and lost 20kg. \nStrict laws are enforced in Singapore for chewing gum, littering, vandalism and “outrage of modesty”, such as inappropriate touching, language and behaviour between couples in public. \nSingaporean punishment by caning made world headlines when American teenager Michael Fay was sentenced to six strokes for spray painting cars and stealing road signs. \nReduced to four strokes on appeal, Fay was caned on May 5, 1994 in Singapore’s Queenstown Remand Prison. \nMen who have been caned say the pain of the blows, applied with the full force of the jailer’s arm, was “excruciating” and “beyond description”. Insulting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe or his office can land you in prison. Picture: AP/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi Source: AP \nLast year, Germans Andreas Von Knorre and Elton Hinz were sentenced to nine months’ prison and three strokes of the cane for breaking into a train depot and spray painting a train cabin. \nThailand imprisons people for insulting its king, while Kuwait has strict laws with jail sentences for using social media to criticise local politics and also its Emir, Sheikh Sabah IV Ahmad al-Jaber Al-Sabah. \nKuwait also imprisons people for up to 10 years for engaging in homosexual acts. \nIn Turkey, insulting the flag, the nation or its founder, Kemal Ataturk, is a criminal offence, as is defacing local currency or not carrying photographic ID. \nZimbabwe jails people for making derogatory or insulting comments about President Robert Mugabe. MALAYSIA \nIn June this year, a 19-year-old Malaysian man was sentenced to a year in prison for insulting a royal family on Facebook. \nMuhammad Amirul Azwan Mohd Shakri, a labourer, pleaded guilty to 14 charges under the country’s multimedia laws, which forbid people from posting content online that others might find abusive or distressing. \n“Bomb” jokes at Kuala Lumpur airport can also land you in jail. \nMalaysia police have arrested 15 people since last year for saying the word “bomb” in the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. A relieved Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno is released from prison after escaping a sentence for caning after the hospital worker was found guilty of drinking beer in a bar. Picture: AFP Source: AFP Malaysia’s ‘Banksy’, artist Fahmi Riza posted this on Twitter after he was charged over depicting Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak as a clown. Source: Supplied \n“Many of them were caught saying the word ‘bomb’ jokingly at the baggage check-in counter and in the airport vicinity,” District police chief Assistant Commissioner Abdul Aziz Ali said. \n“People must know that this not something you can joke around as it can bring about serious consequences.” \nMalaysian graphic artist Fahmi Reza was arrested earlier this year for drawing a clown caricature of the Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, which went viral. \nJudicial caning, ordered as part of a criminal sentence is imposed in Malaysia always in addition to a prison sentence for adult offenders. \nIn 2009, hospital worker Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, was sentenced by a sharia court to six strokes of the cane and a fine for drinking beer in a hotel bar. \nOne day before the sentence was due to be carried out, the Sultan of Pahang commuted the sentence to three weeks of community service. \nIn 2010, three Muslim women were caned by order of a sharia court for adultery, the first time women were caned in Malaysia. Thanakorn Siripaiboon was imprisoned for making sarcastic remarks about the Thai king’s favourite dog. Picture: Vichan Poti/Pacific Press Source: australscope THAILAND \nThe Thai king Bhumibol, now aged 88, enforces the rules of “lèse-majesté”— which means “injured majesty”— which can punish the slightest insult against his monarchy. \nLast year, factory worker Thanakorn Siripaiboon was charged by a military court for making a “sarcastic” comment about King Bhumibol’s favourite dog, Copper. \nBhumibol had adopted Copper, a mongrel from the litter of a street stray, and written a book in 2002 about his “humble and respectful” hound. \nThanakorn was threatened with up to 37 years in prison for a series of online postings that also allegedly defamed the king. \nA military court also sentenced a 49-year-old single mother to 19 years imprisonment after she posted an image of a military tank with a message saying that a “counter-coup” was on its way to overthrow the government. When travelling in Kuwait, do not insult the name of the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah or you can be jailed. Source: AFP The laws of Thailand make it an offence punishable by prison sentence to insult the Thai King Bhumibol. Source: AFP \nThe jail term for the woman using the Facebook identity ‘Chanisa Boonyajinda’ was halved after she pleaded guilty. \nIn 2011, a Thai court sentenced a man to 20 years in prison for sending text messages deemed insulting to the monarchy. \nAmpon Tangnoppakulis, 61, who became known in Thailand as “Uncle SMS” during the case, was found guilty after sending four messages to the private secretary of then-prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. German national Andreas Von Knorre arrives to the state court in Singapore where he was sentenced to caning by the rattan for vandalising trains. Picture: AFP Source: AFP SINGAPORE \nSingapore has a history of strictly enforcing its law against vandalism, but it is also illegal to \nsmoke in public places or indoor restaurants, spit or chew gum or tobacco, to litter or jaywalk. \nCaning can be imposed for rioting and for visa offences. \nYou can be imprisoned for bringing in e-cigarettes, e-pipes, e-cigars, and refills, even for personal consumption. \nAirline passengers who become intoxicated, behave badly or use offensive language during a flight may be arrested on arrival in Singapore. Similar behaviour in transit may also lead to arrest. \nDriving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence in Singapore, punishable by up to 10 years’ prison. Australians know that Indonesia has the death penalty for drug trafficking, but Townsville man Nicholas James Langan was jailed for a year for sharing a joint. Source: Supplied \nMyriad laws in African countries restrict the behaviour of tourists but one of the most well-intended has resulted in people being imprisoned for merely carrying a plastic bag. \nRwanda outlawed plastic bags for environment reasons, but the legislation created a black market and anyone caught carrying a bag faced months in the country’s infamous prisons. \nEvery Australian traveller should know the laws against drug trafficking in Indonesia following the death penalty sentences given to Bali 9 ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran last year. \nBut Townsville man, Nicholas James Langan, managed to get locked up for a year just for sharing a marijuana joint on a Bali beach. \nDenpasar District Court in Bali found him guilty of abusing a type one narcotic and jailed him for 12 months. Freedom Fighters 15:46 \nPrisoners in Thailand are literally fighting for their freedom, where winning tournaments can give them a chance of an earlier release. April 30th 2015",

Warren Pac-12 pecking order shifting so far this season \nWashington quarterback Jake Browning, left, celebrates with wide receiver Aaron Fuller (12) after Fuller caught a pass from Browning for a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Stanford on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Posted: Tuesday, October 4, 2016 5:39 pm Pac-12 pecking order shifting so far this season Associated Press | 0 comments \nPHOENIX (AP) — The Pac-12 may be going through a geographical shift in its pecking order. \nOregon and Southern California, once the power centers of the conference, have dropped to the bottom. Washington and Colorado, typically near the cellar, have shifted toward the top. \nIt\u0027s still too early to know if this movement is permanent; there\u0027s nearly two months until the Pac-12 Championship game in Santa Clara. \nEven if the changes aren\u0027t for good, it\u0027s sure made for an interesting season in the Pac-12 so far. \nA look at how the divisions stand heading into this weekend\u0027s games: \n___ \nNORTH DIVISION \nOregon and Stanford have dominated the division and, for that matter, the conference. The Cardinal and Ducks have combined to win the last seven conference titles, including five times in the Pac-12 Championship game. \nThis season, the Washington Huskies have been the top dog. The Huskies are 5-0 and lead the Pac-12 North after beating Arizona and Stanford to open conference play. They moved up to No. 5 in the AP poll this week, their highest ranking in more than a decade. \nWashington has a chance to end a long streak this weekend when it faces Oregon, a team that\u0027s beaten the Huskies 12 straight times. \n\"We\u0027re kind of burying our head in the sand,\" Huskies coach Chris Petersen said. \"I think they have done a good job of just paying attention to what\u0027s important and practicing hard and all those type of things.\" \nStanford appeared to be the team to beat in the North after crushing Southern California and holding off UCLA. The Cardinal (3-1, 2-1 Pac-12) are still ranked No. 15 and certainly could make a run at the division title, but last week\u0027s 44-6 loss to Washington was ugly. \nOregon, once a perennial national-title contender, has fallen hard this season. \nAfter a pair of high-scoring wins to open the season, the Ducks (2-3, 0-2) have flailed the past three weeks, losing to Nebraska, Colorado and Washington State. The start has led to coach Mark Helfrich feeling heat from a fan base that had become accustomed to winning with Chip Kelly at the helm. \n\"We are built around people and culture and character and it\u0027s in times like these you need them the most,\" Helfrich said. \"Not when the seas are calm and everything is great, it\u0027s times like these.\" \nSOUTH DIVISION \nUSC won the division a year ago and Colorado finished dead last after winning one conference game. \nThe Trojans and Buffaloes have nearly swapped places this season, becoming two of college football\u0027s biggest surprises. \nThe Buffaloes were picked to finish last in the South again in the preseason poll and looked like they might be in for another long conference season after losing by 17 points to No. 4 Michigan. \nBut then Colorado had coach Mike MacIntyre in tears after beating Oregon for its biggest win since joining the Pac-12 in 2011. The 21st-ranked Buffaloes followed that with a blowout victory over Oregon State to move into the AP poll for the first time since 2005. \nThe Buffaloes (4-1, 2-0) lead the Pac-12 South by a game over No. 24 Utah and Arizona State, which travels to Boulder on Saturday. \n\"Like I\u0027ve said since Day 1, we\u0027re a good football team, and I think every week we\u0027ve gotten better,\" MacIntyre said. \"Every week.\" \nUtah has been a rising force in the Pac-12 the past couple of years, tying USC for second in the South last season after ending up fifth in 2014. \nThe Utes (4-1, 1-1) have a dominating defense and opened the season with four straight wins before losing a close game to California last weekend. They host Arizona this Saturday and are still in position to win the division. \nUSC was a popular pick to win the Pac-12, loaded with talented players on offense. \nThings did not pan out well for the Trojans early in the season. They were blown out by Alabama to open the season then lost to Stanford and Utah in consecutive weeks to fall to 1-3 for the first time since 2001. \nUSC (2-3, 1-2) rallied with a rout over Arizona State last week, but still has a lot of ground to make up to repeat as Pac-12 South champion.",

However, deep down, Sakath is a dog that cares truly and deeply for others. He also knows that one day, someway or another, they will perish, leaving him heartbroken and distraught.

      "text": "October 5, 2016 LONG DOG DERBY ACCOMPANIES WEINERSHINITZELS T he aromas of fresh weinershinitzel, greasy two-pound turkey legs, and the unlimited beer have brought people together with the one thing that matters the most: celebrating good times alongside great company. The Denver Oktoberfest is back for its 47th year, and 2016’s event was no exception to bringing a burst of German culture onto the streets of Denver. Considered one of the best and biggest Oktoberfest celebrations in the United States, the boozy fest has its roots far back in history. Originally established in the early 1800s after newly-married German royalty decided to hanker down with the local townspeople. Today, this mega-event brings more than 350,000 people to downtown Denver to drink, eat, and dance. At Denver’s Oktoberfest celebrations, eating and dancing come second only to chugging infamous German beer. During the day, a cold beer chilled those severely affected by abnormally toasty September weather. One of their standout beverages included the immaculate Franziskaner ($6), a great choice for beginner beer drinkers. This spritzy beverage included the zippiness of different citrus flavors and easily paired with the pretzel next door. For those who weren’t there for the beer, the delicacies worth eating enticed even the most ardent calorie counters. Food ranged from Bratwurst to Weinershitzel to the replica of a small baseball bat also known as the Turkey Leg. Whiffs of these fried foods swirled around the atmosphere, making visitors pull out their wallets again and again. The enormous turkey leg was the equivalent in size to most human heads and took more than half an hour to chow down. Even then, full belly notwithstanding, the craving for other treats couldn’t be contained for very long. The festival may seem like a beer-palooza, but more than anything, it brought the Denver community together regardless of nationality or race. As the traditional polka music blared through the venue, families and friends gathered around remembering that fall is here and so are the laughs. Everybody wore their German best at the annual event. Men wore their lederhosen passed down from generations, and women boasted their empowerment and beauty within their dirndl, a traditional Bavarian dress. Diversity is constantly evolving, a fact showcased at the Denver Oktoberfest. The one event that transported visitors into Germany without leaving the mile high state showcased the best of puppy entertainment. On Oct. 2, the last day of the two-week event, hundreds swarmed the small block of Larimer to see the finest Dachshunds around in the Long Dog Derby, which brought together the finest of the breed. Some were longer, some shorter, but all were notoriously spunky. They all attempted to run down a 20 foot track without easily being distracted by the overwhelmingly large audience. Though beer was once the original intent of this event, that stereotype was proved wrong as the people of Denver gathered to watch each other dance to polka music, eat in the halls of table, or simply people watch. It might be a year from now until Oktoberfest lands in Denver once again, but the aura of community and friendship as portrayed by Oktoberfest is here to stay throughout the autumn season and beyond.",

      "text": "Add to Favorites \nIn this short film--which is part of the Pedigree global Feed The Good campaign and video series--we are introduced to Liz Oleska who one morning saw her son off to school, not knowing it would be the last time she would see his face. The single mom’s eyesight deteriorated later that day and she almost gave up hope--until a dog named Brice entered her life, turning everything from dark to light. \nTitled Dark to Light , this short--in support of Blindness Awareness Month this October--was also created in a second format that uses descriptive video services (DVS) to voice over the visuals displayed on the screen, ensuring the visually impaired can experience the film as well. \nA creative team at BBDO NY conceived of the video which was directed by Nathan Caswell, Jeremiah Zagar and Khyber via production house Public Record.

      "text": "  Laura Ainsworth - Keep It To Yourself (2011) Today, 10:12 Title : Keep It To Yourself Year Of Release : 2011 1. Keep It To Yourself2. While The Music Plays On3. April Fooled Me4. Dream A Little Dream Of Me5. He\u0027s So Unusual7. La Vie En Rose8. That\u0027s The Kind Of Guy I Dream Of9. Love For Sale11. Skylark12. Fantastic Planet Of Love Dallas, Texas-based Laura Ainsworth, though performing last-century throwback cocktail jazz, may have stumbled into a zeitgeist defining moment with the album-opening title track from Keep It To Yourself. Whether she knew it or not back in the recording studio, this delicious tale of revenge exacted on a serial philanderer is perfectly of the moment in this period of celebrity male misdeed from the likes of Tiger Woods, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Anthony Weiner. Singing in a satiny, impossibly old-fashioned, nearly three-octave voice, Ainsworth is the very portrait of West Coast cool. Credit the able assist provided by keyboardist Brian Piper, who also works as a producer on the project and lent his regular working trio to provide the crisp, understated musical setting. Unfortunately, “While the Music Plays On,” the more conventional sax-driven second track on Keep It To Yourself, can’t match that kind of ripped-from-the-headlines immediacy. And the album mostly continues along that vein, often settling for a comfy nostalgia that never quite reaches the same fizzy melding of old and new. That’s not to say it all isn’t very charming, or to take anything away from Ainsworth’s facility as an urbane chanteuse. No, she sings the heck out of these songs – from the Liza-ish “April Fooled Me,” to her plucky pirouette around a clarinet on “Dream a Little Dream of Me” and “He’s So Unusual,” to the sassy Rosemary Clooney-influenced “That’s the Kind of Guy I Dream of.” And it’s not even that these are simply tried-and-trues, the kind of all-but-worn-out standards that have become part and parcel of the dog-eared so-called American songbook. Instead, “That’s the Kind of Guy” is actually an unreleased Nat “King” Cole side that was last widely heard as a Betty Hutton b-side back in 1952. Helen Kane’s “He’s So Unusual” goes even further back, to 1928. There’s just a different fun explorative kick, however, to tracks like “La Vie En Rose,” where Ainsworth stomps on the gas after a pillowy French ballad-style opening, skipping into a fun 1930s-era Parisian jazz rhythm complete with an imaginative turn by violinist Milo Deering of the jazz/bluegrass fusion group Beatlegras. Piper and Co. also bring an interesting Pat Metheny-esque modernity to “Fantastic Planet of Love,” offering an album-closing glimpse of what Ainsworth would sound like outside the arid confines of post-war cliches. Elsewhere, though, Ainsworth plays it straight on “Love For Sale,” and the results are sensual, appropriately done, but nowhere near as intriguing. “Personality” has a winking sensibility, but its broad cabaret style doesn’t give her talent enough credit. It’s too cute by half. And, of course, Ainsworth has no trouble with the Ella Fitzgerald gem “Midnight Sun.” After all, she grew up around this smoothly ingratiating style of music; her father was renowned big band performer/arranger Billy Ainsworth, who accompanied legends like Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett. Still, the younger Ainsworth should know better than most how difficult it is to match not just Ella’s dizzying talent but her memorable gumption. This one, again, feels too safe. That said, Ainsworth goes on to pull off perhaps the biggest surprise of all on Keep It To Yourself, an update that emerges as the transcendent moment every singer hopes for when they dig out one of those dusty, decades-old favorites. It arrives in the form of “Skylark,” a been-there, done-that warhorse from Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer. Working in much the same way as her musical heroes once did, Ainsworth recorded the tune live in a single take. Perhaps just as importantly, though, she did so in a fresh new format alongside jazz guitarist Chris Derose, a regular accompanist for Willie Nelson and Michael Feinstein. The results are devastatingly beautiful, nakedly honest, and a powerful argument for the ageless compositions that Ainsworth so clearly treasures. She’s not wrong to love them. She’s just got to remember to keep goosing them into a new age. (Nick DeRiso)",

They also cost a lot of money, according to State Farm, the country\u0027s top auto insurer, which says the average claim hovers around $4,000. \nDeer, with their big eyes and fluffy white tails, may look innocent enough. But they kill more Americans than any other animal. \nNot that they mean to. These deaths occur when cars driven by people crash into deer that are crossing roads. And they\u0027re especially likely to happen over the next three months, when deer are friskily roaming around in search of mates to make fawns with. \nEach year, deer in the United States are involved in more than more than 1 million collisions that cause more than 200 human deaths. They also cost a lot of money, according to State Farm, the country\u0027s top auto insurer, which says the average claim hovers around $4,000. \nThe company, in its annual effort to urge people not to smash into deer, recently used its claim data to come up with rankings for where such a collision is likely to happen. The most perilous state is West Virginia, whose drivers have a 1 in 41 chance of hitting a deer. Californians can breathe easier - their chances are 1 in 1,064. \nSo what should you do to stay on the safe side of those probabilities? Definitely the basics: Buckle up, keep your eyes on the road and not your phone, pay attention to deer-crossing signs. High beams can help (but, please, don\u0027t blind oncoming drivers). And if a deer darts in front of you, don\u0027t swerve - that can cause you to run into a tree or another car. \n\"Hit the damn deer,\" a Wisconsin auto body shop owner who does lots of business in deer-damaged cars told Slate last year. \"If you have time to stop, then stop. But don\u0027t swerve and risk your neck over a deer - or worse yet, over a dog or a squirrel. Believe me, I\u0027ve seen it happen.\" \nYou could also hope for the continued spread of cougars in the United States. Researchers have determined that if the big cats repopulated the eastern United States, they could kill and feast upon enough deer to prevent about five deer-vehicle collision fatalities in the region each year.

      "text": "Yes sir, I have have been in that crazy situation twice.\nOnce when I was young and my parents were towing their new TT with moms Oldsmobile. We towed it from southern Ontario back to northwestern Ontario, some 800 miles or about 1350 km. This was not so much weight issues as the weight of the tow vehicle and going down a long hill, tail wagging hte dog kind of situation. It was crazy and I remember as a kid seeing the TT out the side window at one point. Dad masterfully got it back under control with no damage. Weight police take it easy. Towing with a car was common practice back then and the TT was only 20\u0027.\nI then had it happen to me the first time I carried my racecar on a newly purchased used racecar trailer. Pretty hairy situation just as I was getting up to speed on the highway. I got it back under control and cruised slowly to the track. We put a bunch of weight out front to keep it tracking right after that. I guess it was designed with the intention of a bigger toolbox, spare parts and rack full of tires up front.\nNonetheless It is seriously dangerous and can get out of control very easily.\nBoth times it probably looked a lot like that video.",

      "text": "October 5, 2016 Wonderful Wednesday Thirty Eight I’m peering at the laptop through teeny tiny knackered eyes tonight, I had an exam at 9.30 on Tuesday morning, so of course my brain went into overdrive at about 3 a.m. and just kept going until…well, now! Thanks brain, you’re the BEST. Whilst I’m super chuffed that it’s over, my nervy perma-awake brain means that I’m not so much with the words right now, I could probably tell you all about Lasting Powers of Attorney and discounted gift trusts if you’re interested. Anyone? Tumbleweed in three, two, one… \nOn with the wonderful* \nTopping this week’s list of good bits is getting this exam out of the way obvs. I’ll have plenty more to come over the next couple of years so I don’t quite know why this one (Trust Planning if you care) got me so worked up but it did. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of relief that comes with a good solid ‘pens down people’. \nSaturday and Sunday. HOW beautiful and un-Autumn was this weekend? I anti-Hygge’d my butt off, jumper and sock free in the garden for a bit. This weekend also marked that most wonderful of times when the pooches are allowed back on the beaches. We spent a couple of hours at one of our favourite spots, basking in the sunshine and watching Betty go batsh*t crazy on the sand. That dog sure does love the beach. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I started reading it in the sunshine on Sunday and managed about 30 pages before I had to make someone take it off me and hide it so I could crack back on with the revision. I can’t give you any spoilers because I’m not very far in but so far it’s fantastic. \nDate night with K. Now she’s a working girl, we hardly see K at home these days. On Friday she and I had a cheeky date night complete with Chinese food, the naffness of Burlesque and boy chat (her, not me. It would be beyond weird to boy-chat with my step-child about her father!) Sometimes it’s the little moments with the ones you love that make a week. \nPoldarking It Up A Treat. A beautiful friend brought me some good-luck-in-your-exam giftage. She is widely acknowledged to be the queen of presents so when she rocked up at my door with a cute little good luck angel keyring and a POLDARK FLIPPING COLOURING BOOK it was no surprise. Guys, it’s amazing! It’s full of line drawings of scenes from actual Poldark so it is as creepy as it is incredible. You must all buy it right now. \nMonday Morning Run. Before knuckling down to a last day of cramming I went for a run on Monday morning. Look how pretty, hashtag no filter, it sort of made up for falling on my bum in the mud and straining all the muscles. Because it was Monday morning there wasn’t a soul about. Just me and my spaniel dogs and the great outdoors. Bliss. And that’s about as good as it gets this week. How’s yours been? \n*every week I write something similar and every week I yell it in my head in a ‘LET’S PLAY DARTS!’ style. Just me? \nSally is the founding mother of Wonderful Wednesday but this little bunch is growing all the time, go visit these wonder women Kate , Helen , Jo , Cat , Emma , Sam , Laura , Kerri , Peta , Sarah , El , Jasmin and Mimmi they’re all full of the cheer. \nLet us know if you decide to join in, there’s a hashtag and everything #wonderfulwednesday \nAll the happy.",

There is no way it would take 3 days of digging. Also I dont know where OP is getting the 250 guys number. That would be an insane number of guys to commit to 70\u0027 of digging. It would equate to one dude for every 3 1/2\" of trench. Not to mention there are hundreds of other ways of fishing wire through pipes without digging them up.\nI dont doubt they used this dog to fish a wire through some pipe, bug I think they are greatly exaggerating how much it saved them.",

      "text": "Posted by ronell-smith \n\nNot very edible corned beef hash\nHere I am, seated in a Manhattan, New York restaurant, staring at corned beef hash that looks and tastes like what I imagine dog food to look and taste like.\nI’m pissed for two reasons:\nIt cost nearly $25 and was entirely inedible I should have known better given the visuals depicted after doing a Google image search to find the dish, which was offered at a nearby restaurant In retrospect, I should have checked A and B on my phone before ordering the $25 plate of Alpo. And though I didn’t do that, other would-be customers will, which means the business owner or SEO had better follow the steps below if they wish to stay in business.\nThe bad news is I no longer relish the thought of eating at high-end NY restaurants; the good news is this experience totally reshaped the way I view mobile, opening my eyes to simple but very effective tactics businesses of all types can immediately put to use for their brands.\nMy mobile education\nWe’ve all heard how mobile is transforming the web experience, reshaping the landscape for marketers, brands and consumers.\n\nAs marketers, we now have to account for how our content will be accessed and consumed on mobile devices, whether that’s a phone, tablet or phablet. As brands, we realize our efforts will be judged not only on how well or high we show up in the SERPs, but also on much we can delight the on-the-go prospect who needs information that’s (a) fast, (b) accurate and (c) available from any device.\nAs prospects and consumers, we’ve come to know and value customer experience in large part because brands that use mobile to deliver what we need when we need it and in a way that’s easily consumed, have earned our attention — and maybe even our dollars.\nBut that’s where the similarities seemingly end. Marketers and brands seem to get so wrapped up in the technology (responsive design, anyone?) that they forget that, at the end of the day, prospects want what they want right now — in the easiest-to-access way possible.\nI’ve come to believe that, while marketers appreciate the overall value of mobile, they have yet to realize how, for customers, it’s all about what it allows them to accomplish.\nAt the customer/end-user level it’s not about mobile-friendly or responsive design; it’s about creating an enviable customer experience, one web searchers will reward you for with traffic, brand mentions and conversions.\nI was alerted to the prominence of mobile phone use by noticing how many people sit staring at their phones while out at dinner, even as family members and friends are seated all around them. “How rude,” I thought. Then I realized it wasn’t only the people at restaurants; it’s people everywhere: walking down the street, driving (sadly and dangerously), sitting in movie theaters, at work, even texting while they talk on the phone.\nOne of my favorite comments with regard to mobile’s dominance comes with the Wizard of Moz himself, when he shared this tweet and accompanying image last year:\nMobile isn’t killing desktop. It’s killing all our free time. http://pic.twitter.com/pXb7F7aWsP \n— Rand Fishkin (@randfish) December 20, 2015 \nBut my “aha!” moment happened last year, in Manhattan, during the corned beef hash episode.\nAfter working until brunch, I…\nOpened iPhone to Google Typed “Best corned beef hash near me” Scanned list of restaurant by distance and reviews Selected the closest restaurant having \u003e 4-star review ratings Ended up disappointed That’s when it hit me that I’d made errors of omission at every step, in large part by leaving one very important element out of the process, but also by not thinking like a smart web user.\nNormally my process is as follows, when I wish to enjoy a specific meal while traveling:\nOpen iPhone to Google Search box Type “Best near me” Scan list of restaurants by distance and reviews Select restaurant having \u003e 4-star review rating but has excellent reviews (\u003e 4.5) of the dish I want and has great images of the dish online Delight ensues That’s when three things occurred to me like a brickbat to the noggin’:\nThis is a process I use quite often and is one that has proved quite foolproof It’s undoubtedly a process many other would-be customer are using to identify desirable products and services Marketers can reverse-engineer the process to bring the customers they’re hoping for to their doors or websites. ( Eds. note: This post was created with small business owners (single or multiple location), or those doing Local SEO for SMBs, in mind, as I hope to inform them of how many individuals think about and use mobile, and how the marketers can get in front of them with relevant content. Also, I’d like to thank Cindy Krum of Mobile Moxie for encouraging me to write this post, and Phil Rozek of Local Visibility System for making sure I colored within the lines.)\nFive ways to create an enviable customer experience on mobile #1 — Optimize your images\nImage optimization is the quintessential low-hanging fruit of online marketing: easy to accomplish but typically overlooked.\nFor our purposes, we aren’t so much making them “mobile-friendly” as we are making them search-friendly, increasing the likelihood that Google’s crawlers can better decipher what they contain and deliver them for the optimal search query.\nFirst and foremost, do not use a stock image if your goal is for searchers to find, read and enjoy your content. Just don’t. Also, given how much of a factor website speed is, minify your images to ensure they don’t hamper page speed load times.\nBut the three main areas I want us to focus on are file name, alt text and title text, and captions. My standard for each is summed up very well in a blog post from Ian Lurie, who proposes an ingenious idea:\nThe Blank Sheet of Paper Test: If you wrote this text on a piece of paper and showed it to a stranger, would they understand the meaning? Is this text fully descriptive?\nWith this thinking in mind, image optimization becomes far simpler:\nFile name: We’re all adults here — don’t be thickheaded and choose something like “DSC9671 . png” when “cornedbeefhash . jpg” clearly works better. Alt text and title text: Given that, in Google’s eyes, these two are the priorities , you must make certain they’re as descriptive as possible. Clearly list what the image is and/or contains without weighing it down with unneeded text. Using the corned beef hash from above as a example, “corned beef hash with minced meat” would be great, but “corned beef hash minced meat and diced potatoes” would work better, alerting me that the dish isn’t what I’m looking for. (I prefer shredded beef and shredded potatoes.) Caption: Yes, I know these aren’t necessary for every post, but why leave your visitors hanging, especially if an optimal customer experience is the goal? Were I to caption the corned beef, it’d be something along the lines of “Our corned beef hash with minced meat and diced potatoes is one of our most popular dishes.” It says just enough without trying to say everything, which is the goal, says Lurie. “’Fully descriptive’ means ‘describes the thing to which it’s attached,’ not ‘describe the entire universe,\u0027” he adds.\nAlso, invite customers to take and share pictures online (e.g., websites, Instagram, Yelp, Google) and include as much rich detail as possible.\nWhat’s more, it could behoove you to have a Google Business View photo shoot , says Local SEO savant, Phil Rozek of Local Visibility System. “Those show up most prominently (in the Knowledge Panel) for brand-name mobile searches in Google.”\n#2 — Make reviews a priority\nMany prospects and customers use reviews as a make-or-break tactic when making purchases. Brands, realizing this, have taken note, making it their charge to get positive reviews.\nBut not all reviews are created equal.\nInstead of making certain your brand gets positive reviews on the entirety of its products and services, redouble your efforts at getting positive reviews on your bread-and-butter services.\nIn many instances, what people have to say about your individual services and/or products matters more than your brand’s overall review ratings.\nI learned this from talking to several uber-picky foodie friends who shared that the main thing they look for is a brand having an overall rating (e.g., on Yelp, Google, Angie’s List, Amazon, etc.) higher than 3.5, but who have customer comments glorifying the specific product they’re hoping to enjoy.\n“These days, everyone is gaming the system, doing what they can to get their customers to leave favorable reviews,” said one friend, who lives in Dallas. “But discerning [prospects] are only looking at the overall rating as a beginning point. From there, they’re digging into the comments, looking to see what people have to say about the very specific thing they want. [Smart brands] would focus more on getting people to leave comments about the particular service they used, how happy they work with the result and how it compares to other [such services they’ve used]. We may be on our phones, but we’re still willing to dig into those comments.”\nTo take advantage of this behavior,\nIn addition to asking for a favorable review, ask customers to comment on the specific services they used, providing as much detail as possible Redouble your efforts at over-delivering on quality service when it comes to your core offerings Ask a few of your regulars, who have left comments on review sites, what they think meets the minimum expectation for provoking folks to leave a review (e.g., optimizing for the desired behavior) Encourage reviewers to upload photos with their reviews (or even just photos, if they don’t want to review you). They’re great “local content,” they’re useful as social-proof elements, and your customers may take better pictures than you do, in which case you can showcase them on your site. Relevant content:\n60+ Questions to Troubleshoot and Fix Your Local Reviews Strategy How to Execute the Perfect Local Reviews Strategy #3 — Shorten your content\nI serve as a horrible spokesperson for content brevity, but it matters a great deal to mobile searchers. What works fine on desktop is a clutter-fest on mobile, even for sites using responsive design.\nAs a general rule, simplicity wins.\nFor example, Whataburger’s mobile experience is uncluttered, appealing to the eye and makes it clear what they want me to do: learn about their specials or make a purchase:\n\nOn the other hand, McDonald’s isn’t so sure what I’m looking for, apparently:\n\nAre they trying to sell me potatoes, convince me of how committed they are to freshness or looking to learn as much as they can about me? Or all of the above?\nWeb searchers have specific needs and are typically short on time and patience, so you have to get in front of them with the right message to have a chance.\nWhen it comes to the content you deliver, think tight (shorter), punchy (attention-grabbing) and valuable (on- message for the query).\n# 4 — Optimize for local content\nLike all of you, I’ve been using “near me” searches for years, especially when I travel. But over the last year, these searches have gotten more thorough and more accurate, in large part as a result of Google’s Mobile Update and because the search giant is making customer intent a priority.\nIn 2015, Google reported that “near me” searches increased by 34-fold since 2011.\nAnd though most of these “near me” searches are for durable goods/appliances and their associated retailers, services, including “surgeons near me,” “plumbers near me,” “jobs near me,” etc., and other things that are typically in a high consideration set are growing considerably, according to Google via its website, thinkwithgoogle.com.\nA recent case study of 82 websites (41, control group; 41, test group) shows just how dramatic the impact of optimizing a site for local intent can be. By tweaking the hours and directions page titles, descriptions and H1s to utilize the phrases “franchise dealer near me” and “nearest franchise dealer” the brand saw mobile impressions for “near me” more than double to 8,833 impressions and 46 clicks. ( The control groups “near me” impression share only rose 11%.)\n\nImage courtesy of CDK Global \nAdditional steps for optimizing your site for “near me” searches\nProminently display your business name, address and phone number (aka, NAP) on your site Use schema markup in your NAP In addition to proper setup and optimization of your Google My Business listing, provide each location with its own listing and, just as important, ensure that the business name, address and phone number of each location matches what’s listed on the site Consider embedding a Google Map prominently on your website. “It’s good for user experience,” says Rozek . “But it may also influence rankings.” #5 — Use Google App Deep Linking\nWe’ve all heard the statistics: The vast majority — in some circles the figure is 95% — of apps downloaded to mobile devices are never used. Don’t be deceived, however, into believing apps are irrelevant.\nNearly half of all time spent on the web is in apps.\nThis means that the mobile searchers looking for products or services in your area are likely using an app or, at the very least, prompted to enter/use an app.\nFor example, when I type “thai restaurant near me,” the first organic result is TripAdvisor.\n\nUpon entering the site, the first (and preferred) action the brand would like for me to make is to download the TripAdvisor app:\n\nMany times, a “near me” search will take us to content within an app, and we won’t even realize it until we see the “continue in XX app or visit the mobile site” banner.\nAnd if a searcher doesn’t have the app installed, “Google can show an app install button. So, enabling your app for Google indexing could actually increase the installed base of the app,” writes Eric Enge of Stone Temple Consulting.\nFor brands, App Deep Linking (ADL), which he defines as “the ability for Google to index content from within an app and then display it as mobile search results,” has huge implications if utilized properly.\n“Think about it,” he writes. “If your app is not one of the fortunate few that get most of the attention, but your app content ranks high in searches, then you could end up with a lot more users in your app than you might have had otherwise.”\n(To access details on how to set up Google App Deep Linking, read Enge’s Search Engine Land article: SMX Advanced recap: Advanced Google App Deep Linking )\nIf your brand has an app, this is information you shouldn’t sleep on.\nTypically, when I conduct a “near me” search, I click on/look through the images until I find one that fits what I’m looking for. Nine times out of ten (depending upon what I’m looking for), I’m either taken to content within an app or taken to a mobile site and prompted to download the app.\nSeems to me that ADL would be a no-brainer.\nOptimizing for mobile is simply putting web searchers first\nFor all the gnashing of teeth Google’s many actions/inactions provoke, the search giant deserves credit for making the needs of web searchers a priority.\nToo often, we, as marketers, think first and foremost in this fashion:\nWhat do we have to sell? Who needs it? What’s the cheapest, easiest way to deliver the product or service? I think Google is saying to us that the reverse needs to occur:\nMake it as fast and as easy for people to find what they want Better understand who it is that’s likely to be looking for it by better understanding our customers and their intent The sales process must begin by thinking “what specific needs do web searchers have that my brand is uniquely qualified to fulfill?” In this way, we’re placing the needs of web searchers ahead of the needs of the brand, which will be the winning combination for successful companies in the days ahead.\nBrands will either follow suit or fall by the wayside.\n\nSign up for The Moz Top 10 , a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

      "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police investigating 911 calls from a home linked to Southern California\u0027s \"furry\" dress-up community found two young girls standing on the front porch, three slain bodies inside and a blood-spattered dog, court papers on Tuesday showed. The documents, published by the Orange County Register, shed new light on the shotgun killings in late September of 39-year-old Jennifer Goodwill-Yost, a woman local media described as popular among the Orange County furry subculture, her husband Christopher Yost, 34, and friend Arthur \"Billy\" Boucher, 28.Reuters was not immediately able to obtain a copy of the court documents.Two men who local media say also have ties to the furry fandom, 21-year-old Joshua Acosta and Frank Felix, 25, were arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder.The furry subculture consists of people drawn to anthropomorphic creatures, interacting as their animal identities online and attending conventions dressed in so-called \"fursuits.\"According to search warrant affidavits filed on the day of the murder and published on Tuesday, police were called to the beige, one-story home in Fullerton by a child who said that her parents were dead.Officers arrived to find two girls, aged six and nine, standing on the front porch, the affidavits show. Inside, one of the male victims was dead on the couch, a gunshot wound to his head.In the bedroom, the officers discovered the body of Goodwill-Yost in a bed, also dead from a shotgun blast, the report said.The remains of the second male victim were found just outside a doorway to the backyard, with wounds that the officers initially mistook for blunt force trauma, the documents show.",

      "title": "ROH Reloaded Lockport Review",
      "text": "Lockport, NY Keenan Center \nRing of Honor’s Reloaded Tour continued in Lockport, NY and began with Kevin Kelly and Steve Corino on commentary as Adam Cole made his way to the ring to address the crowd. \nStorytime with Adam Cole (Bay-Bay) \nCole began by informing the crowd that despite Nigel McGuinness’s request that he defend his title against a local underdog, he does not feel that anyone in the area or the locker room is worthy enough to receive a title shot. He did say that he will be watching the Honor Rumble closely and that he will be joining Kelly and Corino on commentary. Corino let out a hoop until Cole said that we would be much better on commentary than the two sitting at the table and Corino was caught on camera looking like a wounded puppy dog. He went on to say that no matter who wins, he will hang on to the title and that if one of the Young Bucks wins, the crowd in Lakeland Florida will witness a five star “Finger Poke of Doom”. \nJonathan Gresham vs. Kamaitachi \nKamaitachi refused to adhere to the code of honor and the two circled each other as the bell sounded. Gresham took his opponent down with a fireman’s carry that led to a series of quick reversals from both men, with working submission holds, focusing on Kamaitachi’s arms. The match sped up as both men stood each other up with should blocks until Gresham used his momentum off the ropes to knock Kamaitachi to the outside, punctuating the action with a tope suicida. \nKamaitachi played cat and mouse with Gresham, allowing him to sunset powerbomb Gresham onto the apron and then whipped Gresham into the ring barricade. Gresham was able to throw Kamaitachi to the ring post, but missed a chop, striking the post instead. Kamiatachi missed a knee drop, allowing Gresham to attempt a shooting star press that was blocked by Kamaitachi, but connected with it a second time after an impressive moonsault from the second to the outside. Kamaitachi’s victory roll off the top rope was a bit sloppy and was not enough to keep Gresham down, but after dropping him Gresham on his head with a modified death valley driver, Kamaitachi won via pinfall. \nWinner: Kamaitachi \nROH World Tag Team Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin vs. Matt Jackson Veda Scott joined commentary before the match began and the company’s resident lawyer postulated that Ladder Wars VI is unfair to the Addiction and show how the company is stacking the deck against the current world tag team champions of the world. Before the match could even begin Matt Jackson dove through the ropes and hit Daniels with a suicide dive. Sabin would not be kept out of the fun as he jumped off the tope rope to the outside. Jackson called for the Rise of the Terminator and he caught both his opponents with a plancha over the top rope. \nDaniels allowed Sabin and Jackson to argue, attacking them as they were unaware of his presence and tossing both into the ring barricades. Back in the ring Daniels began to work over Jackson, slowing the match down. Sabin attempted to get back in the match, but Daniels assured himself of better odds by kneeing Sabin back to the arena floor. As Sabin looked to have the match won after dropping Jackson onto the mat with Cradle Shock, Daniels snuck up behind him and rolled him up with a schoolboy, stealing the victory. \nWinner: Christopher Daniels \nJay Lethal vs. Silas Young In the short time before the two adhered to the code of honor and locked up with each other, Silas did everything in his power to deride the fans in attendance, scowling at even his supports. You don’t see the dedication to adhering to one’s character the way that Young does on a nightly basis. SIlas wrenched Lethal’s arm and both men showed off their agility as the rolled out to reverse each other’s wristlocks and hammerlocks. Lethal was in control until Young countered with a dropkick, only escaping further punishment by surprising Young with a cutter. \nKelly and Corino revealed and confirmed that BobbY Cruz asked to be a part of the Honor Rumble and Kelly laughed off the perspective of a ring announcer having a shot at the ROH World title. In the ring Silas used every heel tactic at his disposal to work Lethal over, including a back scratch before he disrespectfully booted the former champion about the head. The action spilled to the outside, allowing Lethal to attempt his trifecta of tope suicidas, but after the second successful dive Lethal grabbed his knee, writhing on the arena floor. \nA hobbled Lethal rolled Silas back into the ring, but his Lethal Injection attempt was countered and after a series of strikes that the crowd got into, Young stated there would be no more of that and he changed tactics hitting a backbreaker/clothesline combination. Lethal countered a superplex attempt and fly from the perch with a Hail to the King, but Young lifted his boot ggfor the block. Lethal anticipated the boot and after a Lethal Combination, he successfully hit Hail to the King. A Young suplex attempt to the timekeeper’s table led to a cutter and then a Lethal Injection from the former House of Truth member ended the match in pinfall. Great match in the sweltering heat and the two shook hands as a sign of respect from the warriors. \nWinner: Jay Lethal \nNick Jackson vs ROH World Tag Team Champion Frankie Kazarian vs. Alex Shelley \nThe match started with the trio exchanging arm drags and side headlocks as Kazarian positioned himself as the target. Shelley and Jackson hit some Motor City Machine Guns offense and then even too sweeted, to the delight of the crowd. Shelley held Kazarian for a double axe handle, but Jackson chose to hop down and too sweated Kazarian in the eye. The two even combined to hit Rise of the Terminators, but when Jackson called for a second attempt, he used the opportunity to superkick Shelley in the face. \nJackson and Shelley went at it until Kazarian came in and started beating Shelley down. Jackson joined the commentary team briefly until Kazarian had SHelley set up for a Five Star Meltzer Driver. Jackson, however, chose to superkick Kazarian instead. Kazarian was able to score a two count by pinning both men with a bridging jackknife/northern lights suplex combination.Shelley was able to hit Jackson with Slide Bread #2 and then dropped Kazarian with Automatic Midnight for the win. \nWinner: Alex Shelley \nThe Cabinet (Kenny King, Rhett Titus, Caprice Coleman) vs. ACH, Jay White, and Lio Rush \nThe Cabinet took a knee during the code of honor to protest the disrespect that the Cabinet is shown, all in the name of Colin Kaepernick. The three came out of the kneel and attacked the opponents right away, essentially starting the match on the outside. White, ACH and Rush took turns dropkicking Coleman in the corner once the match shifted to the inside. Corino and Kelly discussed whether or not “running a train” was an acceptable phrase, with kelly growing sheepish. In the meantime, Titus gained control over Rush and the Cabinet made quick tags, working him over and keeping him on their side of the ring. Both teams traded control and worked really well together, the heat notwithstanding. The end saw King superplex Rush, with Titus following with a frog splash and Coleman capping it off with a leg drop to earn the win for his team. \nWinners:ACH, Jay White, and Lio Rush \nThe Briscoes vs. Colt Cabana and Dalton Castle \nAfter teaming in a six man tag the night before, Castle and Cabana reunited to take on ROH’s longest tenured tag team, Jay and Mark Briscoe. The teams adhered to the code of honor, with Castle being a bit cheeky during the show of respect. Cabana started off against Jay, with Jay being able to drop Cabana to the mat through a series of reversal after a collar and elbow tie up. After the two wrestled to a stalemate, Jay tagged out to Mark, who demanded that Castle come in. Castle believed that Mark pointed to a fan, went over the said fan and then vowed to wrestle on his behalf. \nThe two teams had to modify some of their exchanges as the ropes and middle of the ring became slippery due to the extreme heat in the building. As the Briscoes were setting up for a Doomsday Device, Cabana thwarted Mark from jumping off the top, but only staved off the loss. Castle German suplexed Jay, but Mark scooped him up and planted him with a quick Death Valley Driver and flew off the top turnbuckle with a Froggy-box, pinning Castle for the three count as Jay fought Cabana off. Winners: The Briscoes \nHonor Rumble \nCole came out to the commentary booth and apologized to Corino for not texting earlier, but he needed Corino to go fetch him a coffee, which Corino did begrudgingly. The match began with Silas Young and Jay Lethal, the next opponent to enter after two minutes, with every wrestler subsequently entering after a minute. Corino came out at number eleven, apparently as a response to Cole ordering him around. Martinez was given time to impress in the ring during this match up and eventually was eliminated almost simultaneously with Bull James, a surprise entrant, at the end of the match. Both men continued to brawl on the outside and if James remains on the roster, these two could possibly continue these hostilities. Entry Order",

      "text": "By Shirley Anderson \n\nJust like any other training, learning to become a dog trainer requires your patience and commitment. It is important for you to engage professionals with the right attitude and skills. At the end of the day, you are the one who will benefit from the lessons. Therefore, you need to pick a perfect coach to guide you. Outlined below are things that will enable you to understand how to become a dog trainer GA .\n\nAmong the tips is, looking for an experienced coach to guide you. Experience determines the ability of a professional to train other people on puppy training. It is hard to learn from a rookie because they do not have any experience in the field. The only way that will guarantee you adequate training is, engaging an experienced and professional instructor. Experience is a central element for all instructors.\n\nAgain, think about the status of the service provider. Learning from a highly regarded professional is the best move for any student. It is thus paramount for clients to look for people who enjoy trust from many in the public domain. The most reliable individuals have a better chance of delivering sufficiently on a training job. Besides, most previous clients trust their services and thus the right ratings in the job.\n\nA coach who focuses so much on theory rather than practical is not fit. Learning practically in the field is the best way to acquire skills. Field interactions with the puppies will give you a chance to experience how a person can manage the pets. As long as you are hands-on, you will learn a lot compared to others. Practical learning is the best approach to make a perfect coach and an excellent student.\n\nNonetheless, learners should find out whether there are any certifications required before becoming a puppy trainer. In most cases, some states will require you to acquire certificates to proof your capability. Under such case, you should look for a certification body to provide you with the documentation. Otherwise, it would be wrong to work against the laws of the country or state.\n\nThe appropriate specialist to train you should have the right accreditation documents. An accredited individual has the right skills and competencies to guide novices. It is, therefore, necessary for people to appreciate the existence of qualified and certified professionals to guide them on poodles training. Ensure that you appoint a person whose level of understanding in the field is exceptional.\n\nYou should know the areas you are not conversant with in puppy training. Seeking help from experts is paramount for any person who is not conversant with the techniques of training the puppies. However, not all specialists have what it takes to serve you suitably. The best thing is to hire an expert who understands all relevant areas to train and learner on in the field. Knowing every bit of the course is chief.\n\nChoose a renowned instructor who can guarantee you the best skills. Imparting a learner with the right skills requires a person who understands the task very well. Working with the best instructors and schools will assure you great satisfaction in the training.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFind details about the benefits of becoming a dog trainer and advice on how to become a dog trainer GA area at http://agooddog.com now. \n",

      "text": "/u/Mycd on A fly trap at my in-laws\u0027 farm We bought one of those thinking it would help for our back yard. No, it was a horror show. Just setting it up was nasty. Essentially you mix putrescent egg yolks in water, open the thing up for business (one way trip for flies), and set it up to allow you fly-free living for up to 90 days.\nIn the heat of summer...\nWithin 20 feet of our back door...\nSo the miracle behind the \"bait\" is that it smell like ass, not the kind of ass-smell that can be washed away with a good scrubbing. I\u0027m talking the kind of ass that brings all the flies to the yard. The kind of ass that distracts them from dog feces and makes them elect to go to it instead of the fresh dump sitting 25 feet away. And when the wind catches said smell, it can be detected by meager human noses all the way across the street.\nOn the bright side, the death-barrel seemed to be almost 100 percent efficient. Dead flies all in that thing. It\u0027s satisfying until you realize that the corpse-island of flies, once created, provides an amazing breeding ground for flies that can make their home in this thing. Once some of the water evaporates off, it becomes a toxic sludge of bacteria-egg water with an iceberg of dead flies creating a buffer for about 1/4 cubic feet of space, which the (doomed) flies have more time to live instead of drowning upon running out of energy.\nSo what do they do? They f*ck. On their dead friends. And apparently 140 degree heat doesn\u0027t mean much to this generation of spawn. They get big and fat off of the corpses of their brethren, but ultimately fail to pupate and so there is a writhing mass of maggots recycling the dead flies underneath. Then more flies are attracted and they no longer have the space to roam freely due to the burgeoning nursery under them. So they die before making sweet love on the biomass of dead babies already in the container.\nThis continues until thousands of flies are trapped, hundreds are born, and the hotel of nightmares fills to the point there flies that enter can leave freely and the trap becomes useless. Then you have to throw the thing away. But the method of activation for it is such that to close the container means pushing the cap down to lock it. This requires spare volume in the container, which there is none. So leaving it open keeps the now-ungodly smell emanating, attracting all sorts of undesired insects, dogs, cats, what have you. If you dare to move the plunger-style cap down, an ooze of fly parts and maggot corpses extrude from the holes in the top. Then, shocked in abject horror, you may or may not drop said container, and your dog with very fluffy hair may or may not roll in the corpse stew f*cking IMMEDIATELY after you may or may not have dropped it. Then you may or may not vomit while trying to bathe said dog as hundreds of twitching fly corpses drop into the drain of the tub because you were so done with life that you forgot you had a hose outside that could have at least washed the parts off before picking the dog up and going inside.\nTL:DR: Please, God, don\u0027t buy this unless you plan on setting it at least 1000 yards away and never plan on touching it again.",

And I don\u0027t do that\nWith people I respect, or at least I\u0027m upfront\nIn telling them if I might be doing that.\nLook, my love languages are quality time and touch,\nSo if you can find time to f**k other bints\nAnd expect me not to get bent when you play with my heart,\nThen you might as well expect me to fart unicorns,\nOr lick thorns for personal amusement.\nDear Lord, get a grip.\nI\u0027m not your little trip,\nThe thing you keep in your pocket\nAll day long (ahem, that might be\nYour hard on...but since I\u0027ve never\nBeen down there, don\u0027t expect me to\nCare too much about the details)\nAnd I get you\u0027re in a hard place right now.\nMy heart goes out to you on that journey.\nYou still don\u0027t get any special excuses\nFor assholiness in affairs of the heart.\nSure, you can act out and mess around all you want.\nYou\u0027re not my problem.\nBut don\u0027t think you can treat me\nHowever you please\nAnd never have to think how your actions\nAnd choices\nAffect me,\nFree from consequences.\nThere are consequences.\nBecause there are treasures\nWe are put on this earth to measure\nAnd honor with our gratitude and appreciation,\nAnd if I am nothing to you, may your actions reflect this truth.\nBut if I am something to you, your actions have poorly reflected this truth.\nLet\u0027s be clear, I don\u0027t need forever with you.\nI offered it because I thought you needed security,\nAnd I was willing to consider you, because I liked you,\nAnd I could imagine wanting you for years to come,\nBut honestly maybe even one night, one great thrill,\nWould have been enough to sate me.\nI\u0027d have remained yours gratefully, at least in one memory,\nAnd moved on.\nWas that the part that scared you? Or was it the promise\nOf something new, something longer and stronger than a night?\nI have a right to judge you and act on my judgment of you.\nMy life needs me now--needs me to fight for it and make it happen.\nI think by many\u0027s standards I have been more than generous,\nI have been profligate with you.\nThinking perhaps all I had to do was throw love at you,\nAnd you\u0027d feed on it and grow into the person you craved to be.\nSo let\u0027s take a hard cold look at you, a hard cold look at me.\nAre you happy with who you\u0027ve come to be?\nI am no longer happy with playing echo to the chained narcissus of your being.\nLet him free. You don\u0027t need me for that.\nI said it once, I\u0027ll say it again: Get over yourself.\nThen you might feel free enough to step off the shelf of defensiveness\nAnd stick your toes into the living world of presence and intimacy--\nThese are present, now, not distant figures of eternity.\nI will no longer play along with your fantasies.\nThe logic is simple\nI have not honored myself in this\nI have relegated my self to a shelf in love\u0027s supply closet\nAnd for this I take responsibility\nThings will change now\nI will say, \u0027no\u0027 boldly\nAnd walk away coldly without regrets, as needed\nI am a treasure, you know enough to know that\nIt\u0027s not my business if you are conflicted as to whether\nYou are worthy to receive me\nBecause if I try to tell you you are\nYou\u0027ll just deceive me and yourself\nPretending you are helpless, unworthy and undecided\nWhen really deep down you\u0027ve turned it around\nAnd made me into some dog that pleases you\nOnly when you have the time for her\nAnd I prefer something different\nIn my life\nI imagine you do too \u003cdiv class\u003d\"dev-title-container",

When checking out I needed help getting my luggage out of the room and into the car as I walked my son\u0027s dog. They got my car from the valet, brought my luggage down and loaded my car. I could not have been more appreciative. We were in town for my son to interview at Baylor. The hotel was close to the hospital which made it convenient to drop him off.

      "text": "​Rad Rides, Eats \u0026 More - The Vital MTB Guide to Northern British Columbia ​Spirit, Soul \u0026 Vibe \nWhether approaching from the Yellowhead Highway or Highway 97, the first impression of Northern British Columbia , Canada can be summed up in two words: limitless terrain. Most of British Columbia’s population is located near the 49th parallel, leaving the northern portion of the province largely untouched. Mountains, wildlife and lakes outnumber the towns and their inhabitants by a significant margin. Many of the small communities exist due to the resource industry. On the other hand, some towns exist solely for their solitude and pristine wilderness access. Each community has a unique character that blends old-school industry with new-school eco-conservation, and what is remarkable is how these seemingly opposing groups not only coexist, but in general they are understanding of each other’s needs and supportive of one another. \nNorthern BC is a true wilderness experience, regardless of the natural resource industry. The majority of the area is either Provincial Park or protected wilderness, and the outdoor recreation opportunities are infinite. Guests to this area should make time for more than just the mountain biking. Blending rides with hiking, fishing, paddling the lake and rivers, and mountaineering will bestow travelers a more profound appreciation for this area. Join Rocky Mountain team riders as they explore a few of Northern BC\u0027s finest riding areas. \nAlthough it varies depending on proximity to the coast and surrounding microclimates, Northern BC has near perfect riding weather during the summer months. Temperatures rarely exceed the eighties, and most areas get just the right amount of precipitation during the summer months: enough to keep the trails tacky, not so much to dampen spirits or interrupt an itinerary. \nThere are a number of possible riding stops along Highway 16, including Prince George, Vanderhoof, Fort Saint James, Burns Lake, Smithers, and Terrace. All of these areas are within a short hour or two drive from one another and would make for an excellent trip. We\u0027ll focus this guide on Prince George and Smithers - the two most popular areas - with some sprinkled Burns Lake beta for good measure. Prince George \nPrince George, located at the confluence of the Fraser and Nechako rivers, is known as the \"capital\" of Northern BC. With a population of around 80,000 it is the largest city in the region by a significant margin. Although the First Nations have been in the area for centuries, Europeans first arrived in the early 1,800\u0027s after the creation of a fur trading post. After CN Rail arrived, Prince George became and remains a hub for British Columbia’s industrial economy. Even though PG remains industrial, they have broadened their economic and employment opportunities through all types of eco-tourism. Mountain biking has always had a presence in Prince George (remember Kyle Norbraten\u0027s Train Gap from the Inside Out ?), is now growing, and after having ridden in the area we’re quite pleased that it has. On The Way \nFor those coming from the south, the perfect spot for a thermos of coffee and a history lesson is Fort George Canyon Provincial Park. It\u0027s a short hike to the canyon, where the Fraser River churns abruptly around huge rocks, whirlpools and small islands. Those arriving on the Yellowhead should definitely check out the Ancient Forest hike near Slim Creek, a couple hours before PG. Like Fort George Canyon, the Ancient Forest is a mellow hike, but worthwhile as the forest is a unique combination of temperate rain and boreal forest. We have to admit that we are guilty tree-hugging from time to time, plus these giants offer a nice break from the road and are a great way to get better acquainted with the area. Where To Ride \nMost of the trails in PG are a result of the passionate members of the Prince George Cycling Club . This diverse group does everything from road rides to trail building. Locals don’t seem to care what or how anybody rides, they’re simply stoked to see people out riding. It isn’t uncommon to see a $250 Walmart bike ripping trail alongside a $6,000 trail bike. The crew at Ruckus not only turn wrenches, but they ride hard and are more than happy to point visitors in the right direction. Cruising through endless trees at Otway. - Photo by Graeme Paterson \nAt the shop\u0027s recommendation, we checked out the Otway trails first and it is now our preferred starting point for a trip to PG. The Otway trail network is based at the Caledonia Nordic Ski Club and is perfect for groups with varying skill levels. Most trails can be enjoyed by beginners, but we still found ourselves giggling our way down since the trails are the perfect grade for advanced riders to hit most sections at warp speed. The trails are smooth enough that they encourage riders to let go of their brakes. There is just enough rocks and roots that riding at speed requires full attention. Our favorite option for a quick ride is to climb Curves and Espresso, get a couple of short laps on Freeway and Bad Dog, followed by a longer descent on Rollercoaster, Twister, Deliverance, and wrapping up with Karma, which ends right back at the ski club. This loop takes a couple of hours, helps to shake out the cobwebs from the drive, and can put a grin on just about any rider’s face. Riders looking for a bigger rides can link Otway to the University Trails by riding an hour long double-track connector, but there’s more than enough in this zone to whet your appetite. In this video by Josh Patterson, watch as Ben Yeager samples some awesome Pidherny soil before picking up his big bike. \nOur preferred riding spot anytime we’re in town are the Pidherny Trails. More challenging options can be found in this area and DH bikes are common. This area is more quality than quantity. Older trails have been updated where necessary, but mostly left untouched, and newer trails make great use of the terrain. A perfect example is New England Clam Chowder: a mixed bag of man-made berms, bridges, and natural rhythm sections that offers bonus features and free speed the whole way for riders looking to squeeze every drop from the trail. Though we’re not generally fans of wooden berms, nor do we seek out ladder bridges, PG’s seems to put a smile on our faces every time we visit. A new trail called The Kitchen Sink is quickly becoming a local\u0027s favorite: Dropping into The Kitchen Sink. - Photo by Devon Budd \nPapa Woods DH is another one within Pidherny that we love: the trail begins with a start ramp that could probably pass a building inspection, then endless small jumps, drops and rollers encourage riders to go airborne the whole way down. Our favorite feature on is a small dirt-to-dirt lefthand hip after an optional skinny. It can be boosted or squashed and provides that perfect feeling of flow that only the optimal combination of speed, rhythm and air seem to offer. Just about every feature on the trail can be rolled or sent, and missing tranny isn’t a major concern in either case. A second lap or following a local definitely makes things more entertaining and encourages riders to make the most out of each feature. \nRiders looking for a more adventurous ride should check out Vineyards. This six mile out and back alpine ride is can be a true test of technical climbing skill, and is an absolute blast to descend. From the ridge, riders have the option to hike the 7,000 foot Apse Peak, a mid-sized summit within the Cariboo (Columbia) Mountain Range. Although bikes are permitted, this trail was originally build for hiking and is still a popular route, so give this one a miss on a sunny Saturday. Where To Stay \nNorton Ranch Cottages are located just west of Prince George, but they are worth the drive. There are three cottages to choose from, all of which are perfect for mellowing out after a long day on the trails. The ranch blends country and contemporary in a unique way and is a perfect venue for a couples’ mountain bike retreat. When traveling on a more modest budget, we’ve always been stoked on Blue Cedars RV Park , which is located just minutes from the Forest of the World and University trails, which also connect to Otway. It’s possible to spend a few days riding right from the campsite, which is always a blessing after a day or two of travel getting to Prince George. Where To Eat \nWith a population of over 70,000 people, and the slogan “where rugged wilderness and urban sophistication collide,” one might have high expectations for a plethora of dining options. Prince George has great local joints for breakfast , lunch and dinner, and while we haven’t had the opportunity to visit them all we’re more than happy to point visitors in the right direction based on our experience. Margo’s Café and Sassafras Savouries are both unassuming local spots where visitors and folks alike can get a bite to eat and a caffeine fix before a day on the trails. Amigo’s Taco Shop is a quick, delicious Mexican option for lunch and now has two locations in town. Achillion Greek Cuisine and Nancy O’s are two of our favorite casual dinner spots and they’re only a few blocks apart. \nWith hydration being such an important part of mountain biking, we would be foolish not to include some of Prince George’s best opportunities to rehydrate after a ride . Pacific Western Brewing has been refining their craft for half a century and it shows in each of their brews. Don’t believe us? Fortunately they’ve got a tasting room for folks to draw their own conclusion. Cariboo Brewing is a British Columbia classic, and depending on accommodations riders might be heading conveniently past on the way to and from Pidherny. Crossroads Brewing is an ongoing project, but they’re hoping to be up and running in late 2016. Those who prefer that the beer come to them needn’t worry: The Kask Taproom and Eatery is set to open shortly too. Smithers \nThe Northern BC town of Smithers is situated along the Bulkley River and is flanked by the Hudson Bay and Babine Mountain Ranges. This small town is unique from the surrounding communities and is one of our favorite towns in all of British Columbia. While many inhabitants in towns such as Prince George are largely industry focused, “Smithereens” are faithful environmental stewards. The red brick sidewalks, Swiss-style alpine rooflines, art and music scene, and town culture all seem to cater to outdoor recreationalists, rather than industrialists. The legacy of artists, musicians and athletes who have come from this small community imply that Smithers is a little bit of a special place, and we admit that we’re in agreement. This town is well worth the trip. On The Way \nFortunately for riders, heading to Smithers from Prince George means opportunities to stop in Vanderhoof, Fort Saint James, and Burns Lake for additional riding opportunities. \nThanks to a recent trail expansion effort to the tune of more than a million dollars, Burns Lake is very deserving of a day or two of your journey. We aren’t really sure how many members the Burns Lake Mountain Bike Association has, but we’re guessing that those they do have are extremely passionate riders, builders and cycling advocates. For just a couple thousand residents, Burns Lake boasts an enormous trail network. Boer Mountain has a handful of excellent trails. When Pigs Fly is a Gravity Logic project that milks every foot of elevation loss; advanced riders will have a blast airing out of corners and hitting the well-built tabletops, and intermediate riders can keep their wheels on the ground without having to worry about gaps, drops or the like. The view from the top of Razorback trail near Burns Lake is well worth the climb, and the ride back down is a blast. - Photo by Glenn King \nRazorback is an ambidextrous cross country option with a few viewpoints, and accesses the upper trails for those looking for meandering singletrack rather than road. Since our quick loops generally turn into a full day, we fill up at Alternative Grounds with a breakfast skillet and a coffee. Where To Ride \nWe already admitted that we’re a little bit smitten over Smithers. The Cronin Trail and Silver King Basin are part of the reason. Ever since our first ride, we’ve wanted to return in order to soak it all in once again. This ride can be done as an out-and-back or as a shuttle up Babine Lake Road, and is our “must-do” in Smithers. The trail uses a combination of mining roads and hiking trails, so the riding itself isn’t berms and flow. It can be challenging in spots and physically strenuous in others, but the Babine Mountain backdrop and Joe L’orsa Cabin are worth the effort. This is an inspiring place to ride, and it encourages you to explore deeper, further and more remote locations that are yet to become beaten paths. Because this route is quite popular with hikers, we recommend riding here mid-week to maximize fun on the descent. The Silverking Basin and Babine Mountain backdrop are breathtaking. - Photo by Melissa G \nThe Ptarmigan Trails are perfect for riders seeking flow and fun. The first time we rode Huckin’ Eh we were a little intimidated by the name… until we came to realize that hucks seemed to be encouraged, rather than mandatory. The rollers can be gapped, rhythmed or simply ignored, but in honor of the trail’s namesake we suggest yanking on the bars whenever the opportunity presents itself. Trannies are good, landings have visibility and goon riding on Huckin’ Eh is a blast. Pump Daddy is a more modern flow trail also worth checking out. There are a handful of short offshoots and stunts lurking in the woods for those with a keen eye too. Those who remember \u0027Routes\u0027 the movie will no doubt recall Wayne Goss and Eric Hillen shredding in Smithers as well. \nSilver King views aside, Piper Down to Backdoor is our favorite MTB specific ride in the valley. Photos of the Piper Down plane gap are floating all over the internet, but our favorite sections of the trail are the natural steeps and slabs between the features. Similarly, the best sections of Backdoor are the natural sections between the built features and lend themselves perfectly to the modern trail bike. The dirt, roots, rocks and grade all combine to make an ideal all-mountain descent that will have riders yipping the whole way down. There are even a few wooden features and creek crossings for variety. In combination, these two trails add up to a six mile, 5,000 foot ride. Wipe the grin off, grab a snack and either repeat the exact same loop, explore the other upper trails, or head to the nearby Bluff Trails to keep the party going. Where To Stay \nAnybody keen to ride in the Babine Mountains and discover the nearby lakes and ridges fully should check out the Aspen Bay Cabins . The cabins are surrounded by trails and anglers can catch dinner in Chapman Lake. In town, Smithers Par 3 \u0026 RV and the Municipal RV Park and Campground are clean, quiet and our favorite spots to catch a catnap in between adventures. Where To Eat \nEvery morning in Smithers should begin with an espresso from the Bugwood Bean. This small, family owned coffee shop not only makes a great brew, but they’ve got fresh baked goods for a quick breakfast on route to the trails. Chatters Pizzeria and Bistro will have jalapeño lovers saluting either the North Central or Chicken Sunrise pizzas, plus there are a plethora of other options for those with milder tastes. Delivery is an option too for those who prefer the food come to them. Our favorite post-ride dinner and drink spot is the Trackside Cantina. This Mexican restaurant combines traditional dishes, local ingredients and a little panache. We must admit that we fancy ourselves as burrito connoisseurs, and the Trackside is top notch. Does it get better than this? - Photo by Graeme Paterson \nWhat else can we say? If it isn’t obvious already, we’re having a little bit of a tough time condensing a lifetime of riding into a few paragraphs. Northern BC is larger than many states and has just about every type of ecosystem you can think of. On top of that there are a pile of villages, towns and cities that are absolutely mental for bikes. We would like to encourage travelers to Northern BC take the time to do it right, rather than trying to pack it all in. Prince George and Smithers are just two examples of what this region offers and there is just too much to experience in a hurried trip to. Our advice is to pack every piece of outdoor gear, a sense of adventure, and start heading north. See More",

      "text": "\u003e\u003e Dayton public transit has a problem with **lawfully carried firearms**! \u003c\u003c\n(and they don’t care about Ohio law)\nLong story, short: for a couple of years, Dayton’s RTA (Regional Transit Authority) has ignored communications from both me and my Dayton friend Albert Cowlan (and others, I suspect) regarding firearm prohibitions in RTA’s “rules”. These prohibitions can be found in the RTA “Facilities Code of Conduct” and “Rules of the Road”.\nMessages would be sent, but either nothing at all, or nothing responsive was forthcoming.\nFast forward to today. I found out that RTA was having a Board of Trustees meeting this afternoon, so I drove to Dayton and attended. I signed up to speak to the board, and told them that as a political subdivision, they had to comply with ORC 9.68, and the rest of Ohio’s gun laws, including those which allow people to carry a firearm outdoors on their public property, and those with a CHL to carry a firearm on their busses. (Oh, did I mention the signage outside the transit center which claimed it was “private property”?)\nThe President of the Board directed me to talk to the CEO Mark Donaghy, who I spoke to after the meeting. Regarding their “rules” against firearm carry, he stated that their “position” was that they were disallowed; essentially saying “So sue us!”. He also made it clear that he had received a number of communications over the years about their non-compliance with the law, but it sounded like they were round-filed. He was extremely arrogant.\nBefore leaving the RTA property, I asked an RTA “security” employee to summon the Dayton police, which he did, and we met outside. The young officer decided to play the role of an arrogant uninformed opinion enforcement officer, insisting among other things that RTA was PRIVATE property. The older LAW enforcement officer suggested I call a Dayton prosecutor whose number he supplied me with rather than returning to my car to retrieve my gun, and carrying on the property. I took him up on his suggestion, but before departing, I told the younger officer that I would make sure he and RTA was straightened out.\nUpdates will be posted as appropriate.\nLink to RTA: http://www.i-riderta.org/\n\"Facilities Code of Conduct\": http://www.i-riderta.org/about-rta/resources/2355.PDF\n\"Rules of the Road\": http://www.i-riderta.org/about-rta/resources/2356.PDF Yes, I do believe in open carry. An openly armed man is clear in his intentions. Concealed carriers are sneaks and skulkers and elitist, boot licking, political contribution making, running dog lackies of The Man . \u003cwink\u003e (thx grumpycoconut - OpenCarry.org)\nGot Freedom?\nAccountant, Computer \u0026 Management Consultant\nScuba Diver, NRA Life Member, NRA Instructor",

      "text": "Alphaleph said: ↑ Caught up with the story.\nYou do good work with the worldbuilding and I await for moar chapters.\nAlso, I find the Compact to be very very grating and I want all of them to burn . Click to expand... Thanks! Glad you\u0027ve enjoyed the story. Like I\u0027ve said previously, I wanted the Compact to not only be a good antagonist, but one that avoids the Stupid Evil ball (or at least as much as I can manage). They are corrupt. They are evil. They keep other species beneath their heel so that the ruling species can live in perfect security and carefully-maintained order and cluck their tongues and the misfortunes of such less civilized, barbaric peoples. If it takes a thousand years to break one of these primitive races, so be it. They will learn their place. Then and only then, will they be rewarded.\nwalkir said: ↑ This reminds me of Shadowrun\u0027s backstory where the cartels founded a legit corporation that decided a multi-billion legal business being subservient to a multi-million illegal one is stupid in every meaning of the word and they wouldn\u0027t take any shit from them anymore. What\u0027s the danger of this in the Red hand? Click to expand... Other than it being an RPG, I know nothing about Shadowrun, but I\u0027d say the danger is minimal. It would take decades at a minimum (or longer) for any one business or side venture to get big enough to out-produce everything the Red Hand was doing and decide to split off. As well, the Red Hand has all the cards, not our hypothetical corporation. They have troops and ships, which would take a corporation a long time to build up on their own (doing something like hiring mercenaries would not only be noticed, but garner some polite requests as to what\u0027s going on), so they could handle it on the direct approach. Or the Red Hand could do indirect and reveal that the corporation used to be one of their fronts. the Compact will step in. They would definitely be interested in the revelation that an otherwise unimpeachable company was a cash cow for an Unbound syndicate. At best, they\u0027d nationalize everything, even if only to seize every financial record and apply what they\u0027ve learned to other companies. At worst, the company would be liquidated and its upper echelons would be arrested, imprisoned and/or executed for colluding with terrorists. It would be like an American company suddenly revealed to be a means for ISIL or al-Qaeda to collect money. The US would stomp on that with both feet and it would be the same with the Compact. Any hypothetical company would have to be extremely powerful and well-connected to survive breaking away from the Red Hand without immediately falling into a titan-scale clusterfuck.\nThere have been smaller cartels that have decided that they\u0027re tired of bending the knee, or various Leaders that have decided to strike out on their own. In some cases, the parting has been (mostly) amicable and the individual(s) offer a gift of \u0027friendship and respect\u0027 and go their own way. It\u0027s when they try to be shirty about the whole thing that discipline needs to be administered, such as a Leader developing new revenue streams, not reporting them and planning to take his operations and run. Or maybe a vassal cartel stops paying tribute, takes out their Red Hand liaisons and goes \u0027fuck you, what\u0027re you gonna do about it?\u0027 It\u0027s in these instances that the axe would come down.\nTheSandman said: ↑ There\u0027s a question that hasn\u0027t come up, I think: how much dissent is there within the Triarchs about the future course of the Compact, and how it should respond to irritations such as LeBlanc? And how much information about such is now available to Echo and (once she wakes up from her nightmare) Nemesis, courtesy of the archives of the Triarch who Redemption of Sol was carrying? Click to expand... We haven\u0027t seen anything of the Triarchs outside of the one aboard Redemption of Sol ; it could very well be that they are divided on certain subjects, but for the good of the Compact, they put on a united front. They are very reclusive and only the Watchers have unfettered access to the the Triarchs and their world.\nRedemption of Sol , as befitting a fleet flagship, would have databanks bursting with highly classified data, but as a vessel expected to confront an enemy who specializes in information warfare, anything that wasn\u0027t deemed mission-critical would have been removed. Echo still has a lot of valuable tactical, strategic and military data but she wouldn\u0027t, to use your example, have anything on the workings of the Inner Council or the ruling members themselves.\nOn a different but likely related topic, when was the last time the Compact promoted a subject species to a ruling one, and when was the last time they assimilated another species as a ruling species rather than a subject? Click to expand... The last client that was promoted to a ruling member were the Justicars/Pentients, which occurred about 1100 years before the story\u0027s events. I haven\u0027t quite figured out where in the timeline to put the Ennobler/Mortificant rise and fall yet, nor have I decided the terms of their introduction into the Compact. The Justicars tried to push for reforms and their frustration at the lack of progress and the attitudes of their fellow ruling members led to them taking actions that led to their downfall. The Ennoblers attempted to seize control of the Compact for themselves. Neither fared well.\nFor that matter, what\u0027s their long-term game plan should they actually win the war with the Principality? Which of the Askanj will be enslaved, which will be exterminated, will any be added to the ruling species list (or to the \"subject we actually might promote once they forget they were ever independent\" list)? And given that the trajectory of the war has been against the Askanj for almost the entire time they\u0027ve been fighting it, what preparations has the Principality made for if or when they can no longer meaningfully resist the Compact? Click to expand... It would be unlikely that any of the Askanj races would be exterminated, at least not before a proper narrative of racial madness could be spun up - and one that would fit with how this supposedly mad dog of a species was able to work with others for as long as they did. It would be vastly more likely that the Askanj Principality would become the Askanj Protectorate, its peoples, planets and species subject to Compact oversight and administration, until it could be wholly certain that the species in question no longer posed a threat to themselves (by starting pointless, bloody wars) or others (by exploiting and enslaving more primitive peoples).\nAs for preparations, it would take some work to convince the Askanj- illth to accept anything other than \u0027fight until the last breath\u0027. They\u0027ve never forgiven the Compact for the conquest of several of their worlds (even if the Compact did trade them back to the Principality) and given their representation in the military, any talk of a negotiated settlement would have to be done with utmost care, since the last thing you want to do is piss off the hundreds of billions snakes that are holding all your guns. If it came down to it, the Principality would probably bend the knee. They\u0027d probably do absolutely nothing (or the bare minimum) to stop their own armouries and shipyards from being looted by incipient rebels, rag-tag fleets and various splinter factions. As well, iif large swathes of their surviving fleet \"went missing\", well, they don\u0027t know where all those officers who\u0027ve disobeyed dutiful orders to stand down and accept the surrender could have gone and the Compact definitely shouldn\u0027t worry about ten, twenty, forty, or a hundred Boltholes popping up in the upcoming decades.\nKayEhn said: ↑ Hey Prox, got a question about the Compact\u0027s Age of Expansion. Is this an ongoing occurrence that we simply haven\u0027t been seeing much because our views remain tied with Nemesis and the like? As in, are there other species and systems actively being conquered across the \u0027map\u0027 from where most of this is taking place; does the Compact still grow in other ways even if its growth is being stymied in one region by the forces that be? Click to expand... It is, yes. The Compact declares a new Age of Expansion roughly once a millennium. It lasts for a couple hundred years, before a Period of Stability is then declared and the Compact\u0027s grasp catches up to its reach. That\u0027s not to say that the Compact isn\u0027t expanding constantly in fits and starts all the time, nor that the Compact doesn\u0027t put any effort towards development and infrastructural support during a major expansion; the titles are mainly for soundbites. Currently, we\u0027re on the twilight of the seventh Age of Expansion as it comes to a close as the Compact\u0027s attention starts to turn inwards. This Age of Expansion has also been heavily focused on liberating as much of the Principality as possible from exploitation and serfdom (insert sense of irony here). We saw very little of it during the first arc, since with the exception of the flashbacks to Vara Tal, all the action took place far from the front lines. In Ascension , the plot is much more focused on the front lines of this war, so it\u0027s been more relevant and thus, we\u0027ve gotten more info on it.\nThe Compact is expanding on almost every front, with some exceptions (i.e. towards the Molten Veneer) and if they\u0027re slowed or stopped on one vector, there are many more in which their expansion is unchecked.\nmosshadow95 said: ↑ Compact Morals are literally a moderate exaggeration of 1870-1950 thought. Wiping them all out is pretty harsh. Click to expand... True; the Compact doesn\u0027t order species death as a matter of course. Humanity was the last major time that this occurred. Normally, the Coimpact simply grinds its client races down over generations until all they remember is the Compact and all they know is service. Even for extremely problematic species, the Compact doesn\u0027t jump right to \u0027kill them all\u0027. Despite the problems that they were causing and their knowledge of Nemesis , Conmurra knew he could never justify exterminating the Verrisha. The public might buy that they were racially insane (i.e. turning their world into a fortress on the off chance an alien species showed up is paranoid if nothing else - nevermind that it was less of an \"off chance\" and more of a \"specific warning\"...) but no one would accept that a species limited to a single world in a single star system would ever pose a threat to the Compact. At the time Earth fell, humanity still had a couple/few dozen systems and dozens of colonies left. Policing all of those effectively would be impossible compared to securing Vara.",

      "text": "Muirshiel to Toward\nForgot to mention that this place (Muirshiel Country Park) is very popular in the evenings with runners, walkers and dog-walkers. Also – a group of young adults turned up, with pizzas and soft drinks, and headed down to the BBQ area, but they were no trouble at all – no noise, no screeching round the car park in their cars.\nAlso – a car turned up at about 9.30 pm, with L(earner)-plates on it. A swap of drivers and then a full 1.5 hours of driving practice – 3-point turns, reversing, driving up and down the single-track road – all very quietly. What a great way of getting experience of driving, especially on the sometimes-rather-scary local roads!!\nCome the morning, the only thing I could \u0027complain\u0027 about was that one of the youngsters had tried to \u0027post\u0027 a pizza box into the doggie \u0027do\u0027 bin. I had to remove it and put it next to the (full) \u0027normal\u0027 bins and tell the warden when she turned up. She ed and told me not to worry – all of the bins are emptied at least once a day.\nMore information for the whole of the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park may be found at:\nhttp://www.clydemuirshiel.co.uk/\nThere were still a few midges about as it was early, but I ignored them, made myself a cuppa and headed off to walk two of the higher level trails (Windy Hill and the Mine Track – total 8 miles – the last 3 of which were done in just under 40 minutes – it takes me a while to get my \u0027walking legs\u0027 back and it was so misty, nothing much to see, on the return trip that I just \u0027yomped\u0027 along.).\nWalking up Windy Hill, Muirshiel Country Park. This photo (taken on my tablet) doesn\u0027t do justice to the brilliant hue of the heather. Wish I\u0027d taken it with my camera..png",

      "text": "When I have that option in front of me, I use the strategies below to help me zero in just ONE. Because of Xmas coming soon you should try to make your Santa costume selections soon, therefore you don’t end up left behind without having your Santa costume. On removing the coat, the Karen Miller dress gives a complete look and gives an ambience as if an angel has stepped into the crowd. Another thing to keep in mind is that you don’t want some family members to be dressed very formally while others are dressed informally. s hope this trend passes quickly, but in the meantime, if you dare, opt for heels and a top that hits at the hip to add length and balance to your super skinny jeans. There are scores of benefits that can be drawn from performing yoga. Whether in nature or on a set, there are often ways to compose shots so as to capture the blackest darkness, the brightest light and everything in between, and if you work to find them, soon you’ll start seeing them everywhere.",

      "text": "/u/bnelson on Someone has been pissing in our elevator for six months. Someone left this note in the elevator, and then someone posted this fake letter from management. This is a day in the life of college student apartment buildings. Lived in an apartment with an elevator. I was on the 4th floor so I always took the elevator. For about 6 months, someone would pee in there almost every day. There would often be a puddle of piss on the floor. We didn\u0027t have janitors, so our maintenance guys would have to come in every morning and clean up a puddle of piss from the elevator, felt so bad for those guys. The elevator began to smell like a stadium bathroom permanently. Being one of 2 people with a dog in my building, my dog got targeted by the residents as the culprit and I would get dirty looks daily. But the amount of piss in there was always way more quantity than my dog was capable of. After a few months of this happening, I began to assume it must be a few people, there would be so much piss in there, it was ridiculous. It didn\u0027t end with the pissing either, soon the elevator started getting vandalized, people would open up the panels, and remove the lights in the elevator. After awhile management started closing the elevator at 10pm every night. So glad I don\u0027t live there anymore, I can still smell the piss. Also, someone posted this in the elevator as a joke, and left one in front of everyone\u0027s doors in the building. I found it funny, but management freaked out. Best part of the whole situation. Someone also left a letter directed at the pisser in the elevator",

This is a day in the life of college student apartment buildings. It\u0027s four stories, I have a fat dog that has to go up and down 3-5 times a day, not to count the time i have to go up and down for class, and work. Sorry if I don\u0027t want to climb and descend 21 flights of stairs a day many flights of which I have to either carry my dog or force her to go up. Not to mention her bad hips which make flights of stairs hurt her.",
