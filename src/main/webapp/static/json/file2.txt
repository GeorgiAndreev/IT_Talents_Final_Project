They have been playing golf in junior tournaments over the last few months at Mt Edgecombe, Beachwood and Royal Durban with great success. Damien O’Connell, Noah Rudwick and twins, Rory and Jordan Bernardis have been upsetting all the record books after playing last weekend in a ‘Big 3 Series’ tournament whrre they won their sections brilliantly. Damien (11) won the B division with 40 points, with little Noah (8) coming second on a count-out with 40 points, also in the B division. Twins, Rory and Jordan (7) played in the “pee wee” division and scooped the first and second places with 50 and 40 points respectively. This is a wonderful result from the juniors – all thanks to Grandpa O’Connell, aka Willie, for all the time he spends with the boys on a daily basis. The twins even practise their putting before they go to school in the mornings. How’s that for dedication? Congratulations to these four very young boys, who are playing golf with such commitment and enjoying themselves at the same time. If there are any youngsters who wish to play in these specially organised tournaments, call the club for more details. \nAs always, the competition last Wednesday was the individual stableford and the winner was one of the women, Michelle van der Merwe who shot 38 points to take the first prize, with Rob Mathias and Mike Harvard right behind her, in second and third places respectively on a count out, both with 37 points. \nSaturday’s Toyota monthly medal was played, even though the field was quite small. It was good to see Sean Prendergast at the club since his move down south. The rain threatened all day, but the players weren’t deterred at all. Winners in the A division were Mike Cromhout with a good 67 followed by runner-up, Saga Reddy on 71. The B division was snatched up by Wally Kent on a brilliant 65 with Bruce Sutcliffe hot on his heels in second place with a 66. The always well supported C division was once again won by John Thompson on an excellent 67 with Tom Naicker right behind him and runner-up with a 68. \nThe women played their monthly medal competition and it was Sabiha Bacaus on a 75 from Denise Nell, the runner-up with a 78. Denise also took home the least putts prize with only 32 putts. Petros Langa won both the jackpot with 10 points and the hidden birdie. There were no two clubs (must have been the wind) and Saga Reddy won the attendance draw. Well done to all the players especially the winners. \nThe .onthly mug winner for October was Wally Kent – well played, Wally. \nThis Saturday, 8 October is the alliance league – get your teams together as time is running out for your team to catch-up in the points department. There will be social golf on Sunday, 9 October – call to book a time on 039-973-1042. \nSince it is school holidays, there is no KidzGolf until the school term starts again, when Devlyn, Lindani and Mike will be back to welcome all the youngsters the following Saturday between 8am and 9am on the practise putting green. \nFor any information regarding tee times and club activities, call the office on 039-973-1042.

Authorities canceled a morning launch at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta due to high winds. (Albuquerque Police Department via AP) \nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — High winds led Albuquerque balloon fiesta officials to ground pilots Monday, a day after two balloons hit power lines, sparking an explosion and knocking out electricity to hundreds of residents. \nThe explosion and outage occurred when the \"Outlander\" alien-themed balloon hit a line Sunday and knocked out power for about 1,200 residents. \nCrews with the Public Service Co. of New Mexico had to cut the gondola from the balloon to rescue the pilot and passengers. \n\"I thought it was just going to go up in flames, but it didn't. Thank God,\" witness Allen Escobar told KOB-TV in Albuquerque ( https://goo.gl/t3dQPs ). \nPhotos and video of the crash posted on social media showed the balloon dangling from utility lines as crews worked to remove it. \nNo one was injured. The only damage appeared to be a hole in the balloon, officials said. \nAnother balloon landed on a power line to the south. A photo released by Albuquerque police showed a balloon hanging from a power line. \nBalloon Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said a female passenger suffered superficial injuries after the gondola was on the ground. She was treated and released from a hospital, he said. \nThe 45th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta began Saturday and is expected to draw close to a million visitors to central New Mexico before it ends Sunday. \nGarrity said the fiesta averages about 4,000 balloon launches and landings and rarely sees accidents. \"But they happen,\" he said, adding that he did not have the average number of crashes at each event. \nThe National Transportation Safety Board said the most recent fatal crash at the fiesta occurred in 2008, when a balloon hit power lines and burst into flames, throwing both men on board to the ground and killing one of them. \nThe year before, a California woman fell at least 70 feet to her death from a gondola, and three other women were hospitalized after the \"Heavenly Ride\" balloon hit a utility line. \nIn 2004, the \"Smokey Bear\" balloon struck a 50,000-watt radio tower. Two young passengers and the 69-year-old pilot were forced to climb down 60 stories to safety as a breathless audience cheered on below. The three were not physically injured.

STEVE MARCUS / Reuters Share advertisement \nDemocrats are hoping to make history by electing the first Latina U.S. senator in a hotly-contested race to replace Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada. Their prospects may be looking up: Polls have tightened over the past week following some local developments that have complicated the GOP's pitch to minority voters. \nFormer Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is their candidate, and on paper, she seems ideal: The granddaughter of Mexican and Italian immigrants, she makes personal pitches to first- and second-generation immigrants on the stump. Like many other multi-generation U.S. Hispanics, she does not speak Spanish fluently but can understand it. She has made outreach to Nevada's sizable Latino community a centerpiece of her campaign and touts her support for progressive policies such as a higher minimum wage and immigration reform.

REUTERS/David Becker/File Photo DAVID BECKER / Reuters \nRepublicans have nominated Congressman Joe Heck, who was elected as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010 and has won his two subsequent re-election fights by increasing his margins. That electoral strength — Heck's district includes much of Clark County, one of the state's two most populous counties, with a demographic makeup that mirrors Nevada's population — is part of what's given Republicans high hopes for his chances at a statewide bid. \nHeck has been winning in the polls, and both Republicans and Democrats involved in the race say that's because, despite Cortez Masto's attractive profile, $15.3 million in attack ads from GOP outside groups have helped her opponents.

(AP Photo/Scott Sonner) Scott Sonner / AP \n\"It's clear that Republicans, and their outside groups, have spent a lot of money trying to define her,\" said Chris Wicker, first vice chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. \n\"We need to make her unelectable,\" said Ian Prior, spokesman for the billionaire Koch Brothers-backed Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, which has already spent over $2.1 million in the race. The Koch brothers fund many conservative causes and have backed the LIBRE Initiative, a group that works in the Latino community for conservative ideals and those who back them. \nBut Democrats point to a trio of bad news developments last week — adding up to what veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston called Heck's \"Terrible Thursday\" — as a potential turning point in the race. \nThat day, a GOP operative mistook one African American elected official for another in attempting to attack Cortez Masto and BuzzFeed published a collection of racist and sexist postings Heck's son made on social media; Rep. Heck subsequently apologized . Moreover, two of Heck's former advisers questioned Cortez Masto's Mexican heritage, including one who said the Las Vegas-born Cortez Masto, whose father is from Mexico but who also has Italian roots, \"is about as Mexican as I am.\" Catherine is about as Mexican as I am. It's relevant when applying for scholarhsips...or running for #nvsen https://t.co/18RzjRbDnY — Tom McAllister (@TMAC702) September 22, 2016 \nHe also asked whether she speaks Spanish, drawing allegations he was questioning whether she was truly Latina based on her language skills. — Tom McAllister (@TMAC702) September 22, 2016 \nAnother former Heck adviser, Mark Ciavola, said of her references to her heritage as \"Hispandering at its finest,\" in a Facebook comment, according to The Las Vegas Sun. Ralston speculated this could drive Latino turnout against Heck, likening it to Trump's attacks on a Mexican-American judge overseeing a lawsuit against him, which even some Republicans decried as racist. Cortez Masto's campaign said the developments were \"huge news,\" and while they won't be airing any ads pushing the issue, they expect them to be a long-term problem for Heck. \nAt a recent press conference, Cortez Masto didn't mince words in hammering Heck for his former aides' comments. \n\"For long-time aides of Congressman Heck to attack my Mexican heritage, claiming that it is only useful for a college application is disgusting,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Joe Heck does not stand for Nevadan values and we cannot afford to have him in office.\" \nAnd a new survey conducted by Bendixen Amandi International for the Las Vegas Review-Journal shows just a narrow, two-point lead for Heck, 47 percent to 45 percent for Cortez Masto — making the two statistically tied in the race. \nRELATED: Koch-Backed Group Spends Millions in Ohio, Nevada Races \nPrior to the \"Terrible Thursday\" developments, however, some Democrats in the state said they were concerned about Heck's lead in the polls. \nYvanna Cancela, political director of the state's powerful Culinary Union, which has endorsed Cortez Masto, , described those polls as \"unnerving, especially in what is definitely going to be a very close race.\" \nCancela said she was particularly concerned that Cortez Masto's lack of name recognition may leave some Latino votes on the table. \n\"There's still a lot of getting to know the candidates that needs to happen,\" she said, pointing to a mid-September Univision News poll that showed 38 percent of Nevada Hispanics aren't familiar enough with Cortez Masto to have an opinion on her; 41 percent said the same of Heck. \nAmong Latinos who did know the candidates, however, Cortez Masto led 58 percent to Heck's 24 percent. \nBut Cancela said that GOP messaging in particular is dampening Latino enthusiasm for the election, a trend that, if it continues, could spell trouble for Democrats up and down the ballot on Election Day. \n\"To say the level of [Latino] excitement is going to reach what it did in 2008 or even 2012 is not fair, because the political climate that Trump & the Republican Party have created doesn't allow for it,\" she said. \nNevada remains one of the GOP's top pickup opportunities, and they're not ceding anything to Democrats — including the Latino vote. Heck's campaign is targeting them with Spanish-language ads, and a number of Koch-backed groups are also actively working to win over Latinos and turn them out to the polls in November.

Em’s final, final plodding total for Tuesday now stands @ sth significantly more than 2132. see, told you I’d pass two grand. XD Anyways, final, final events for tonight? - Before leaving @ 6:30pm , Bessa (or whatever her name really is! XD) took me once more to the loo and I quickly did a stinky unspeakable. Did you know, she’s actually YOUNGER than me! Only twenty-six … but she’s a single mum. - Alas, while I was ready for dinner, PIG mum decided to instead gleefully FORCE L me to stand and use the Wii Fit for her, meaning I had to stand for like forty minutes; argh, I HATES standing practice! >< Well, Monday I was still @ camp; guess that was my one day this week where I didn’t haveta let horrid PIG mum gleefully force me to pointlessly stand for her. *sigh* - Before dinner, I took myself once slowly and safely to the loo and back, rising above the cruel and unfaithful God’s near-overwhelming hatred and not letting Him push me over. - Dinner tonight: the yummy rice, lotsa cos lettuce, lotsa yummy wombok and several wee pieces of beef. - Dinner was spooned down with one bowlful of soup, before I walked myself slowly and safely back online, again rising above the cruel and unfaithful God’s near-overwhelming hatred and not letting Him push me over. - At 9pm , I took myself once more slowly and safely to the loo and back, always rising above the cruel and unfaithful God’s near-overwhelming hatred and not letting Him push me over. - Toms: well, Aunty Deana isn’t coming to mind me till 12:30pm ; I’m presuming PIG mum will either take me out grocery shopping somewhere, else she’ll order that I do more online study. Which reminds me, @ 9:46pm I’ve gotta go e-mail PIG mum this week’s study guide so she can print for me. - Someone’s coming to mind me from 4pm to 6pm ; like I always say, she’s definitely the carer I’ve got who cares the least, but hey. Oh, I can tell her that I finally remembered to Google hangnail and that it’s one word, not two! - And best of all, it’s ice cream night toms night! Like I always say, a very little’s definitely better than none @ all! - Anyways, hope everyone has a smashing day toms!

Em’s new plodding total for Tuesday now stands @ 1986. lol, I’m pretty sure if I can return online after one final loo trip @ 9pm , I’ll have passed 2000 steps. XD Anyways, continuing tonight’s events? - Breakfast was around one bowl of plain porridge with one chunk of unbuttered bread ripped into it, one full mug of water, all my usual drugs :P and one full mug of water. Over breakfast, I also finish my mostly silent chat to Percy the saint/angel. Remember, however the cruel and unfaithful God tries to make my day bad for me, I won't let that affect me because my good day has NOTHING to do with Him; I'm perfectly capable of having a good day without Him, despite Him and apart from Him. See, my good day's dependent on my own good attitude! - After breakfast, I let PIG mum gleefully FORCE L me to walk out to the 4WD, and she tootles us off to Bellas to buy groceries. Of course, she gleefully forces me to buckle my own seatbelt all day; we also listen to some Canto singer all day too … maybe Kenny Bee? Also, today Era helps Ela stretch for thirty-five minutes and Ela opens and closes her palm 250 times, holding each for a count of five. - We buy fruit and vegies from Bellas, then head over and take advantage of the two wraps fore ten bucks @ Subway. Not sure why PIG mum doesn’t let us eat the wraps @ the restaurant and instead tootles us home, but hey. - Physio today: 1.5hr session for Ela: standing five times for reaching, bimanual tasks (bowling, passing ball). Tabita and Ray were awesome: they made a minion from some gym ball for me! :D Juju also came over to help us. - Only coming home, we were stuck in awful traffic! Whilst driving to UQ, someone from CODA rang and said someone new called sth like Bessa would come mind me from 4pm till 6pm today, only we got stuck in awful traffic today and @ 3:55pm I rang CODA and asked Maree (it wasn’t even 5pm yet but she was already the last one left @ the office!) could the carer not come till 4:30pm? - When she did arrive, I headed into the bathroom for my nice hot shower – I washed and rinsed my own hair today. I also sang like 24% of my shorter second-favourite song softly, slowly but most hatefully out aloud, opening both eyes for all the important numbers. - After turning the nice hot water off, I got dried, creamed and rekitted. Heading outside for arvo tea, I was disappointed to see PIG mum still hanging around; no white tea for me, then… *sigh* - Arvo tea was one yummy pear and one mug of green tea. At least I got to suck the teabag once. XD - That finished, I happily read my novel until 6pm rolled around, and I got to watch twenty-five minutes of Seven’s 6pm news! The coolest surname I found was ‘Bear’, BTW. - Anyways, fingers crossed I can brb after one more loo trip with my final, final plodding total for today, the final, final events for tonight plus what’s happening toms, else hope everyone has a smashing Wednesday!

Photograph: Richard Gardner/REX/Shutterstock \nChuka Umunna MP, Chair of Vote Leave Watch, has seized on the slump in the pound to berate the leaders of the Brexit campaign. \nIn a resounding blast, Umunna says: \n“Leave campaigners promised that the economy would be unaffected by a vote to leave the EU. They dismissed every economic warning as ‘scaremongering’ or ‘Project Fear’. \n“Today we see how hollow their assertions were. This collapse in the value of the pound means ordinary British workers will be worse off, as prices in the shops soar and the pound in everyone’s pocket is worth less. \n“The Tory conference in Birmingham reveals three cabinet members responsible for Brexit – Davis, Fox and Johnson – blind to the damage Brexit is already doing to Britain. Instead of rushing to pull out of the Single Market, they should focus on limiting the damage to our economy and maintaining as many of the current benefits we enjoy as possible.” \nUmunna is absolutely right that the weak pound is pushing up the cost of imports; both finished goods and raw materials. \nEven bacon from China could become more expensive too. \nBut other companies say they hope to ‘absorb’ these costs, rather than pushing up prices. For example, baking firm Greggs said today it will do its “absolute utmost” to avoid price rises. 11.53am BST Ireland trims growth forecasts on Brexit fears \nThe uncertainty swirling around the Brexit issue has forced the Irish government to cut its growth forecasts. \nReuters has the story: \nIreland on Tuesday cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2017 on concerns about the fall-out from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and said risks were centered “firmly to the downside.” \nThe finance ministry cut its 2016 GDP forecast to 4.2 percent from 4.9 percent and for 2017 to 3.5% from 3.9% and said there was considerable uncertainty to the outlook for next year with the impact of Brexit still unfolding. \n“We have reduced next year’s forecast by around half a percentage point to take into account the uncertainty associated with Brexit,” John McCarthy, the finance ministry’s chief economist, told a parliamentary committee. \nAround 40% of Ireland’s food and drink exports are sold to the UK, in an example of the close trade links between the two countries. \nDublin is particularly anxious about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU customs union without any new trade agreement. The future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is another obvious issue -- leading to calls today for a new agreement to prevent a ‘hard border’ being established. 11.36am BST \nTime for some history: a market report from the last time the pound was worth just $1.27. A forex report by @dsmitheconomics in the Times, June 15 1985 - about the last time GBP was this weak @TimesArchive pic.twitter.com/6oCsHe7q7f — Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) October 4, 2016 \nHealth worries about a senior US politician? An Argentinian debt crisis? Concern about the oil price? P lus ça change , plus c’est la même chose.... Updated at 11.36am BST 11.27am BST \nMining companies and internationally-focused firms have been the best performing companies on the London stock market this year, as this chart shows: \nIt was sent over by Laith Khalaf , senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown . He reckons the market could still go higher. \nWith cash and bonds yielding next to nothing, equities are the natural alternative for anyone looking for a decent level of income. Nor will there be any shortage of income-seekers at the moment, as millions of baby boomers are reaching retirement age, while the recent pension freedoms conveniently allow them to park their retirement funds in the stock market rather than buying an annuity. \nAnd on some measures, shares aren’t actually too expensive today, he adds: \nIf you compare share prices to company earnings, the valuation of the UK stock market is actually somewhere in the middle of its historic range, neither particularly cheap, nor dear, at current prices. This is in stark contrast to the former peak of the market in 1999, when the price-earnings ratio of the UK stock market stood at an eye-watering level. 10.57am BST City fears hard time after hard Brexit \nThe City isn’t going to get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations, according to a new report that has alarmed some investors. \nBloomberg is reporting that PM Theresa May wants to “change the relationship between the government and the City of London”. \nAccording to three senior figures in May’s administration, the government will refuse to prioritize the protection of the sector after the U.K. has left the European Union. \nHer team has also dismissed the key business demand for an interim deal with the EU to help ease the transition out of the bloc, one of the people said. All asked not to be named because the information is sensitive. Here’s the full piece: Banks to Miss Out on Special Favors in May’s Brexit Plans \nThe City fears a hard Brexit because it could prevent firms in London from offering services across the European Union. \nThose ‘passporting rights’ are highly prized, but would be lost if Britain leaves the single market in 2019. \nThis uncertainty is already making it harder for City firms to plan, or hire new staff. Good @FT chart on role of non-Brits in the City (22% of 360k workforce) pic.twitter.com/v26fYOSwfV — Mark Scott (@markscott82) October 4, 2016 10.50am BST \nTom Stevenson, director of personal investing for Fidelity International, suggests the London stock market could easily keep climbing, despite the clouds of Brexit uncertainty. \n“As the pound plunges to a three decade low, the FTSE 100 has broken through the 7000 barrier, reaching 7,076 this morning, close to its highest ever. The first time the FTSE surpassed this milestone was in March 2015 before rising to its all-time intra-day high of 7,122 in April 2015. Since then we have seen the markets fluctuate, hitting a low in February 2016 of 5,499, before bouncing back again – an increase of 28.6 per cent. \n“This is obviously good news for UK investors and no-one would complain about the market finally moving decisively on from its 1999 dot.com bubble peak. But it should be remembered that the main reason shares are rising today is the remarkable slide in the pound to its lowest level since 1985. It’s good for UK exporters and overseas earners but for foreign stock market investors it takes the edge off the latest gains. \n“Can the market go further from here? Despite coming close to a new high, the valuation of the UK market is not excessive and investors still look to shares for income, growth and stability. 10.25am BST FTSE 100 posts triple-digit gains \nLondon’s stock market is surging higher, sending the FTSE 100 index up by 100 points to a new 16-month high. \nShares in consumer group Unilever, drinks company Diageo, and food group Compass have all hit record highs. \nAnd the Footsie is now hovering around 7084 points, only 38 points shy of its record high. Nearly ever share is up. The FTSE 100 today Photograph: Thomson Reuters \nWe shouldn’t forget the proviso that this is partly due to the weakness of the pound (which boosts the share prices of companies with international earnings, as explained earlier ). \nBut investors may also be showing some confidence in Britain’s prospects; especially after this morning’s strong data from the building secto r. \nChris Beauchamp , chief market analyst at City firm IG , explains: \nThere may be no shortage of commentators pointing out that the index is still down in dollar terms, but with the index at its highest level in over a year there is a distinct feel-good factor among UK investors. \nEuropean markets are joining in the party, with Deutsche Bank shares resilient despite no developments on a potential reduction in the DoJ fine. The traditionally strong quarter for equities has got off to a remarkably good start, although the move has probably been helped by the lack of heavyweight data so far this month. \nToday’s UK construction PMI continues the trend set by manufacturing yesterday, although with so much focus still on the UK’s path to Brexit the relief for sterling has been minimal. If tomorrow’s services number also comes in strongly the Bank of England is going to have a hard time justifying another cut in interest rates.

After weeks of peddling the confusing mantra of ‘Brexit means Brexit’, Theresa May outlined how the country will negotiate leaving the European Union. \nOne of the hot topics in May’s key note speech at the Conservative convention was workers rights. May promised that the rights afforded to UK employees will continue. She said: “The same rules and laws will apply to them after Brexit as they did before. Any changes in the law will have to be subject to full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate. \n“And let me be absolutely clear: existing workers’ legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law – and they will be guaranteed as long as I am Prime Minister.” \nWhile these reassurances will be welcomed, it is impossible to guarantee that these rights will be enshrined in UK law . Much of the country’s employment law stems directly from being a member of the EU. \nTake the EU framework on discrimination that was enshrined into UK law in 2000, which stipulated that an employer cannot vet applicants based on age, sexual orientation or religion. Implementing and upholding this law would normally require a full passage of a new bill, however due to the overwhelming levels of legislation parliament could face, it would be at the prerogative of ministers to uphold such laws. While May has been bullish about the protection of workers rights, putting such power in the hands of the executive team is worrying. \nMay’s speech also raised questions about the rights of existing EU migrants in the UK. The EU may be reticent to negotiate such issues until the ‘Brexit button’ (another of May’s buzz phrases) is pushed in March 2017 . \nSamantha Hurley, operations director at The Association of Professional Staffing Companies (APSCo) feels we may not be able to begin negotiations as soon as the government would like: “What we have now is a definite timetable for Brexit but aside from that it is difficult to predict what Brexit will actually look like. \n“While Theresa May has said that she would want to protect the rights of European nationals working in the UK, she will only do so if British citizens are offered the same guarantees across the EU. However, the EU has made it very clear that they will not start any negotiation talks until Article 50 has been invoked and so any predictions would be merely conjecture.” \nA potential impasse on the rights of habitant EU nationals could prove to be a sticking point for workers rights as a whole. While the government may want to play their cards close to their chest before sitting down with Donald Tusk and Michael Barnier, Hurley feels it is the role of organisations such as APSCo to keep workers at the forefront of the discussion: “We will be lobbying government hard to remind them just how important the UK flexible market is to the economy but it will be difficult for the government to make any hard and fast promises at this stage as they will obviously not want to show their hand before official negotiations start.” \nTheresa May is making all the right promises – it would seem. Not only is she forthright in her claims about workers rights, she has also begun an inquiry into the practices of company’s such as ASOS and Sports Direct that have fallen foul of employment laws. But without a clear path forward in the negotiations with the EU, it would appear such guarantees are built on false ground. While we may have a better idea of what Brexit ‘means’, it’s clear that we have a long way to go before we fully understand the impact it may have on workers’ rights. \n","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"tom ritchie","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"samantha hurley","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"theresa may","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"brexit","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"donald tusk","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"michael barnier","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hurley","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"european union","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"asos","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"eu","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"the association of professional staffing companies","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"brexit","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"eu","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"uk","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:51:27.692+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"76e78ab6809947454cf5253537f88605dac78284","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.50CqzOtNcgKgWdCReAR77b8k5hJgXUZw87aFEQ1S_UkVSKgo3jvbJeJk1YtoCLx1_sgeTS7mxEXPX8A98rwe2","site_full":"www.sugdenbarbell.co.uk","site":"sugdenbarbell.co.uk","site_section":"http://www.sugdenbarbell.co.uk/forum/Training-Journals","site_categories":[],"section_title":"Training Journals Forum.

Then you probably loved this week's edition of Dancing with the Stars, which incorporated the magical world of Cirque Du Soleil into the couples' dances. If only Rick Perry was still on the show and we had the opportunity to see him wear a two-foot long beak and fall into a firedancer in a massive explosion. \nLen wasn't here this week because he was too busy with his other show, Strictly Come Dancing, so automatically everyone was in a better mood. And Tom deemed Bruno should be in charge, which can only mean that the night should end with mud wrestling and Jell-O shots, right? \nLet's review the dances and all the wackiness of the Cirque! \nCalvin Johnson Jr. and Lindsay Arnold - Charleston, music from KURIOS: Cabinet of Curiosities \nThe dance: When I think Megatron, I definitely think \"that guy is totally into Steampunk.\" That's how he and Lindsay suited up for this fun dance that he once again nailed, even lifting Lindsay upside down at one point without breaking her neck. Calvin somehow doesn't have lead feet and glided around like was dancing on marbles. But as the dance wore on, the jazziness went out of Calvin's hands, so he'll probably lose points there. Also, a guy rode around on a bicycle in the air. \nWhat the judges say: OMG Carrie Ann was totally cool with lifts because of the theme! I guess now that Len is out the mice shall play. Maybe Bruno will eat his tie! \nScore: 23/30 (remember, Len is OUT!) \nMaureen McCormick and Artem Chigvintsev - Argentine Tango, music from MystÃ¨re \nThe dance: This dance lacked the energy of the opening Charleston, so at one point all I could do was watch the anthropomorphic parrot jumping around and doing flips in the background. That's one thing about Cirque week, there are so many distractions in the background that it's more like an infomercial for Cirque. And though I wouldn't be caught dead at a Cirque show, I do know that they are physical wonders with superpowers, and when they're anywhere on stage it's like, \"Excuse me dancers, move out of the way and let me watch this feathered human in the ridiculous get up do a headspin and backflip onto their butt.\" In a competition, it's probably more entertaining if the competitors are the most interesting thing out there? Anyway, the Argentine Tango isn't about pizazz, it's so form specific and Maureen was solid up there. But Maureen is about to lose it and I worry about her safety. Does she have the mental makeup to go far? \nWhat the judges say: Bruno said Maureen had \"great lines\" and I agree. (I don't know what that means.) \nScore: 24/30, Maureen's best score by far! \nJana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko - Foxtrot, \"Here Comes the Sun\" from The Beatles LOVE \nThe dance: Jana and Gleb started out a little rough and out of synch, but as things went longer they found their rhythm and at some point Gleb pulled off a WWE move, and flipped Jana over by her neck into his lap and then they hugged and MY GOD when are these two going to get engaged? But it was a well-choreographed routine to one of the best songs of all time. Still, there's something missing from their partnership that keeps their fluidity from really coming together. Just get together and express your love, you two. America demands it! \nWhat the judges say: Both Carrie Ann and Julianne pointed out some stiffness in Jana's shoulders and neck during some passes. Hmmm... maybe a hot oil sensual massage from Gleb will work those kinks out. \nScore: 23/40, and Jana squealed at her first 8. 8s for everyone! Len isn't here! Let the love flow! \nMarilu Henner and Derek Hough - Paso Doble, music from from KÃ \nThe dance: Ha ha! Derek! This guy just goes for it and he was decked out like the Lone Ranger in Wonderland as put together by Baz Luhrmann redoing Ziggy Stardust. And boy was he fabulous in this routine! And with the fire jets and flag dancers all over the stage, I couldn't even see how Marilu did. Everything else was too powerful around her. And at the end she shot a flag like an arrow and killed Derek? I don't know what the story behind this dance was, but I dug it. Still not ever going to see a Cirque Du Soleil show, though. \nWhat the judges say: Julianne loved the whole use of the stage, and true, they danced a few miles in this routine. Carrie Ann thinks Marilu needs to drop some intensity and let Derek in so they can dance together. \nScore: 21/30, and the typical boos from the crowd who want everyone to get a perfect score. Can it, audience! You aren't professional reality dancing competition show judges! \nAmber Rose and Maksim Chmerkovskiy - Argentine Tango, music from Zumanity \nThe dance: This was supposed to be a \"risque\" dance that explored human sexuality but I didn't see it. Maks and Amber rolled around on a table, but I don't know if I found it sexy even though Amber was dressed... let's say \"casually.\" I'm still looking for that chemistry between Maks and Amber. However, it was so much better than last week's booty dance and we're on the right track here for what works for Amber. More of this, less day-glo graffiti, short shorts and awful wigs. \nWhat the judges say: Bruno sounded like he wanted to lick the table! \nScore: 24/30, tied for the high score! Really, a 24? OK! \nRyan Lochte and Cheryl Burke - Viennese Waltz, music from O \nThe dance: \"My game plan for this week is to just go out there and crush it,\" said Ryan. Yeah, bro! Personally, I've been a little disappointed that we haven't seen the Ryan of old while he tries to repair his image. Sigh. Anywho, of all the performers in this thing, Ryan seems like the one who has improved the least. It's the same thing each week. He looks stiff out there, like he's not a dancer. Which he's not! Can't we just accept that? \nWhat the judges say: Carrie Ann disagreed with me and thought Ryan made a huge improvement. Well excuse me! It's like today is EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY day. \nScore: 22/30, Bruno gave an 8. \nKenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Allison Holker - Tango, \"Come Together\" from The Beatles LOVE \nThe dance: This was a good use of the Cirque theme! Definitely the coolest idea of the night, as the couple moved from spotlight to spotlight on an otherwise pitch-black stage, making it all about the dance and them instead of clowns and frilly clothes. But because of the spotlights, you could see where they missed their marks and it started to fluster Babyface to the point where he forgot some steps and lost it. But to his credit, he owned up to it and recognized it with a smile on his face. That's a shame, because the concept was really, really cool. \nWhat the judges say: Ehhh, basically, \"Sorry, bud.\" \nScore: 18/30, low for the night and a potential death sentence for their survival. These two don't deserve to go home tomorrow, but with TWO couples being eliminated, it could very well happen. Especially with all the soft scores going up tonight. \nTerra Jolé and Sasha Farber - Samba, music from O \nThe dance: Hey background firedancer, we know that wasn't real fire! That ruins the whole point of firedancing. Just stop. But the dance! Terra is week in week out the most fun to watch along with from Laurie, isn't she? Terra gets into it, and the Samba is the perfect dance for her personality. I mean, she's great and Sasha choreographs her perfectly, using her height to an advantage rather than a crutch. One of the best dances of the season so far. Will she get a 9? And that hair and zebra print outfit, girl? Rock it. If you're not rooting for her, go jump in a dumpster. \nWhat the judges say: They said Terra was sexy. \nScore: 25/30! Carrie Ann hands out the first 9 of the season, and it was deserved. Terra and Sasha isn't going anywhere. \nLaurie Hernandez and Valentin Chmerkovskiy - \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" from Michael Jackson ONE \nThe dance: Laurie and Michael Jackson isn't even fair, man. The thing about Laurie is that she is having the most fun out there, and it shows. She pops, she flows, she struts, she steps, and every thing is punctuated with natural ability and flair. You watch Maureen out there and she's about to have an aneurysm, and Laurie is out there just dancing. And dancing well! There was even a whole portion of the dance that was just her dancing while the guys let her do her thing. You don't do that unless the \"star\" can handle it, and Laurie is the only one out there who can do that. Put her on the DWTS live show tour! \nWhat the judges say: Julianne was speechless, but did mange to say Michael Jackson was the King of Pop but Laurie is the Queen of the Ballroom. Bruno pulled out an ultimate compliment and said she was a combination of Debbie Allen, Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. So I think they liked it. \nScore: 30/30, perfect score. Surprised? She's safe. It's everyone else who isn't. \nVanilla Ice (Robert Van Winkle) and Witney Carson - music from La Nouba \nThe dance: Sure, Dancing with the Stars is our ENTIRE LIFE and we study it seven days a week, but these stars also have day jobs (well, some of them). And Vanilla Ice had FIVE shows in FIVE cities last week, meaning the rehearsal time was limited. So no, it wasn't the best, but he wore a white top hat and tore up an old couch and made a suit out of it with really long coattails. He and Lochte have similar problems out there, though Ice has less stiffness, and I'm impressed with what he pulled off out there considering his schedule. It was his best performance. If all is fair, it should be enough to keep him around one more week and avoid tomorrow's double elimination. \nWhat the judges say: Carrie Ann noticed some more elegance in Vanilla's performance and Julianne thought the theme fit the night. \nScore: 23/30! Impressive! \nJames Hinchcliffe and Sharna Burgess - Quickstep, music from Paramour \nThe dance: James has fantastic feet! And dancing looks pretty effortless for him, especially in this Broadway-inspired 1920s piece that doubled as a fun skit. He had a few down weeks after a great premiere week, but I think this is the real James and he's a legitimate competitor for the crown. Well, second place after Laurie. A great way to finish the episode. \nWhat the judges say: Julianne is so surprised by James, and we are all too. \"I sit for a living,\" said James. \nScore: 28/30, with a 10 from Bruno! \nDo you agree with the scores? Who do you think is getting eliminated tomorrow? \nDancing with the Stars returns tomorrow with a double elimination at 8/7c on ABC. \n  Dancing with the Stars \n\n\nAbout Us","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"calvin","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"artem chigvintsev","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"maksim chmerkovskiy","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"julianne","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"valentin chmerkovskiy","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"gleb","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"maureen mccormick","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lochte","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"laurie","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"robert van winkle","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"gleb savchenko - foxtrot","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"carrie ann","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jana kramer","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"rick perry","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"marilu henner","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"james","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"paula abdul","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"len","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"maks","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jana","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"edmonds","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"baz luhrmann","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"terra","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ryan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"sharna burgess","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"sasha","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"terra jolé","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"sasha farber","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bruno","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"james hinchcliffe","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"laurie hernandez","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"calvin johnson jr.","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"allison holker","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"debbie allen","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"michael jackson","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"derek hough","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lindsay","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cheryl burke","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"derek","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"kenny","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"janet jackson","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ryan lochte","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"maureen","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lindsay arnold - charleston","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"witney carson","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ziggy stardust","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"babyface","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cirque","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"anywho","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"paso doble","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"abc","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cirque du soleil","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"america","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"charleston","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"la nouba","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"wonderland","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:51:43.291+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"a909350ede0e61a8d3519d4932ba660effa52c2d","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg8qAjAGp3DjaPZuwgrHDl8evsOafaFYOF_ClNQAU8wYb9gHD0KgM8cNOFCWdI6aFmMwKN8kOVlYFQ9XRMdVsTAsV1mwQ4Ip_jPVff.Rk3QS3SiqYO6M2yGRijQvpriwCW30VTddcgcQHNwX2RzUBPlb","site_full":"www.networkworld.com","site":"networkworld.com","site_section":"http://www.networkworld.com/index.rss","site_categories":["tech"],"section_title":"Network World","title":"Salesforce will buy Krux to expand behavioral tracking capabilities","title_full":"Salesforce will buy Krux to expand behavioral tracking capabilities","published":"2016-10-04T16:51:46.371+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":1,"site_type":"blogs","country":"US","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/09/150914-salesforce-dreamforce-3-100614572-primary.idge.jpg","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":10971,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":1,"comments":0,"shares":1},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"a909350ede0e61a8d3519d4932ba660effa52c2d","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg8qAjAGp3DjaPZuwgrHDl8evsOafaFYOF_ClNQAU8wYb9gHD0KgM8cNOFCWdI6aFmMwKN8kOVlYFQ9XRMdVsTAsV1mwQ4Ip_jPVff.Rk3QS3SiqYO6M2yGRijQvpriwCW30VTddcgcQHNwX2RzUBPlb","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Peter Sayer","published":"2016-10-04T16:51:46.371+03:00","title":"Salesforce will buy Krux to expand behavioral tracking capabilities","text":"Salesforce will buy Krux to expand behavioral tracking capabilities Related \nBanners for Salesforce.com's Dreamforce expo hang outside the Moscone Center in San Francisco on Sept. 14, 2015. Credit: Martyn Williams Salesforce plans to add the data collection capabilities of Krux to its CRM platform Email   IDG News Service | Oct 4, 2016 6:14 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nSalesforce.com has agreed to buy user data management platform Krux Digital, potentially allowing businesses to process even more data in their CRM systems. \nKrux describes its business as \"capturing, unifying, and activating data signatures across every device and every channel, in real time.\" \nEssentially, it performs the tracking underlying behavioral advertising, handling 200 billion \"data collection events\" on three billion browsers and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet and set-top) each month. INSIDER Review: Container Wars: Rocket v. Odin v. Docker \nWith that staggering volume of data, \"Krux will extend the Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s audience segmentation and targeting capabilities to power consumer marketing with even more precision, at scale,\" Krux CEO and co-founder Tom Chavez wrote on the company blog. \nThe acquisition will also allow joint customers of Salesforce and Crux to feed \"billions of new signals\" to Salesforce Einstein, a suite of AI-based tools for building predictive models, Chavez said. \nUnveiled two weeks ago , Salesforce Einstein will include functions such as predictive lead scoring and recommended case classification. Some functions will be available for free, while others will be charged for based on data volume and user numbers. \nKrux is part of the Salesforce ecosystem, but also works with other vendors including Oracle, Google's DoubleClick, Criteo and a host of other advertising networks. According to Chavez, it won't be cutting those ties following the acquisition. \"Openness remains a guiding principal,\" he said. \"We expect to continue supporting our thriving partner ecosystem and integrating with a wide variety of platforms.\" \nBusinesses already using Krux to track their customers include media companies BBC, HBO, NBCUniversal and DailyMotion; publishers The Guardian and Financial Times, and food and drink companies ABInBev, Mondelez International, Kelloggs and Keurig. \nSalesforce will pay around US$340 million in cash and a similar amount in shares for Krux, according to a filing it made with the SEC Tuesday.

You don't need your glass window or pen just yet though because we've put together a Season 3 primer to tell you everything you need to know before Barry suits back up. \nArrow, The Flash, Supergirl and DC's Legends of Tomorrow epic four-part crossover has its big bad \nThe Flashpoint of it All \nEpisode 1 is titled \"Flashpoint,\" named for the famous Flash comic-book storyline, The Flashpoint Paradox, where Barry went back in time to save his mom and almost caused the entire DC universe to collapse. We already broke down the major plot points of the comic book here, but sine the CW DC Universe doesn't have a Batman to kill and Superman is still in a completely different dimension on Supergirl, Flashpoint is more of an ode to the comic-book run rather than a direct interpretation. \n\"The Flashpoint paradox is a phenomenal comic book,\" executive producer Aaron Helbing tells TVGuide.com \"With 'Flashpoint,' there will still be certain homages and certain odes, but I don't feel like we're beholden to the comic book. It's so massive in scope, you can't do it. We have to take everything that we can and we put it in The Flash TV show blender and mix it together.\" \nThe Flash is bringing in an Awkward villain this season \nThe Big Bads \nThere will be two big bad villains this season on The Flash, and together they will be a force to be reckoned with like never before for Team Flash. \nDr. Alchemy: Dr. Alchemy will be introduced first in Season 3. In the comic-books, he has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde like-complex due to his multiple personality disorder. He uses his chemistry skills to create \"elemental weapons,\" including bulletproof silicon. Once Dr. Alchemy earns possession of the Philosopher's Stone, he's able to transmute one element into another. In terms of The Flash, they'll have another villain that can compete with STAR Labs team's scientific prowess. The official casting for Dr. Alchemy hasn't been announced yet, but he is being voiced by Tobin Bell at the top of the season. \nThe Flash and Supergirl will stage a musical-crossover this season \nSavitar: Another speedster! Dr. Alchemy will team up with Savitar, who in the comic-books was a former fighter pilot who also gained his speed powers from a lightening strike. Savitar has dedicated his post-lightening strike life to learning how to be faster and has managed to develop powers that none of the speedsters we've seen on the The Flash use before, like forcefields and being able to lend his speed to other objects and people. The one thing he wants most is more access to the speed force though. \nSo together, Alchemy and Savitar are a mad scientist and a man thirsty for knowledge. Helbing also teases that these two will be an incredibly difficult duo for the team to defeat. \n\"I don't think the Flash or Barry Allen or the team, have come up against villains quite like Dr. Alchemy and Savitar. Savitar is going to be, I would say, Barry's most formidable opponent -- especially with Dr. Alchemy. They are two big bads. It's double the trouble,\" he says. \nThe Flash reveals a first look at Kid Flash \nNew Faces \nThe Flash has some fresh blood joining the team, or at least entering the STAR Labs orbit this season. The most notable, of course, is Harry Potter alum Tom Felton who will be playing Julian Dorn.

She and her accomplice Mirror Master (Grey Damon) will be an evil duo who also combine their powers to confound Barry. \nThe Musical Is Coming \nThe executive producers of the CW DC universe announced in August that The Flash and Supergirl will have a special musical crossover episode to make use of both shows' tremendously talented casts. Jesse L. Martin already showed off his singing skills in Season 2, but Grant Gustin is a Glee alum, Carlos Valdes is a Star Kid with Broadway credits and Keiynan Lonsdale is a classically trained dancer. \nThe musical will consist mostly of already existing songs but executive producer Greg Berlanti said he hopes to have at least one original song per episode of the crossover. \nWhat are you most excited for in The Flash Season 3? \n(Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS, one of the CW's parent companies) \n  The Flash \n\n\nAbout Us","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"alchemy","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"keiynan lonsdale","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dean buscher","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"helbing","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"harry potter","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"savitar","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dillion","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"grant gustin","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"aaron helbing","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jesse l. martin","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jekyll","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hyde","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"barry allen","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"greg berlanti","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"rosalind","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"grey damon","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"barry","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dorn","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom felton","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"julian dorn","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"superman","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"carlos valdes","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ashley rickards","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"cw","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dc","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"star city police department","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"flash tv","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cbs","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tobin bell","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"star labs","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"broadway","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:51:47.029+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"8452a96b0081839111126d569e26191278fb712a","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.7Mf_vUwbHGkpftADccPjfqsGGBv6u4L7gw_CD4IZuv5XD20o1fR0SyZgxWNe8.5sqfks24ij0oz1PF3H58SkUuc5nFpPNh5kuxYriHPJ0AsxIQ_kECJ3hQFRtOIMAlcpd6mo3dj3L1zpDhgVnjzG4","site_full":"www.news-sentinel.com","site":"news-sentinel.com","site_section":"http://www.news-sentinel.com/news/local/rss","site_categories":[],"section_title":"News Sentinel - Local","title":"Safety Director Rusty York to retire before City Council can eliminate job","title_full":"Safety Director Rusty York to retire before City Council can eliminate job","published":"2016-10-04T16:33:00.000+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://assets.mediaspanonline.com/prod/13332120/met-031216-york-JPG.jpg","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":null,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"8452a96b0081839111126d569e26191278fb712a","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.7Mf_vUwbHGkpftADccPjfqsGGBv6u4L7gw_CD4IZuv5XD20o1fR0SyZgxWNe8.5sqfks24ij0oz1PF3H58SkUuc5nFpPNh5kuxYriHPJ0AsxIQ_kECJ3hQFRtOIMAlcpd6mo3dj3L1zpDhgVnjzG4","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:33:00.000+03:00","title":"Safety Director Rusty York to retire before City Council can eliminate job","text":"Safety Director Rusty York to retire before City Council can eliminate job Rusty York John Crawford Russ Jehl   8:33 AM Rusty York wants to go out on his own terms. That's why Fort Wayne's safety director and former police chief planned to announce his retirement Tuesday before City Council would have a chance to eliminate it. \"I have no regrets, no hard feelings. I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish,\" said York, 65, who has been safety director since 2013 and will retire Dec. 1, ending a city career that began with the old City Light electric utility in 1969 and included 39 years in the Police Department,13 of them as chief. Although York believes the timing of his announcement is right for a variety of reasons, it comes as council begins its annual budget review — a review that was likely to eliminate the $120,000-a-year safety director's position come Jan. 1. Council tried to end York’s job earlier this year but balked after Mayor Tom Henry’s administration threatened legal action because state law requires salaries to be established no later than Nov. 1 for the following budget year. But the Republican-dominated council said in February it planned to revisit the issue when preparing the 2017 budget, Councilman John Crawford said council was likely to revisit the future of York’s job as early as Tuesday.“I’m sure it will be discussed (as part of the salary ordinance),” said Crawford, R-at large. “If you simply cut (the position) from the budget, you could keep the position (under another title) and pay it.” The city was without a safety director for 13 years before Henry restored the job in 2013 and promoted York from police chief to fill it. Critics consider the position, which oversees police, fire and other safety-related functions, redundant. Supporters insist it allows police and fire chiefs to focus on their departments’ core duties, but Henry told The News-Sentinel last month that “I feel for at least one year more, Rusty is needed to mentor our two new chiefs.” Steve Reed was sworn in as police chief Aug. 1; Fire Chief Eric Lahey began his job in June 2014. York believes the position is still valuable but said he has confidence in Reed, Lahey and other safety officials. He plans to teach criminal justice class at IPFW and spend more time creating leaded glass items — something he's had little time for lately. \"It was always a job in progress, but I'm proud of improving the relationship between the community and the police. That's why we haven't seem some of the problems here (other cities have experienced,\" he added. With council set to consider a two-year contract for firefighters Tuesday and a collective bargaining agreement for police after that, Crawford said it may also be time to revisit an ordinance tabled last December that would have ended taxpayer funding for union activities. Proposed by Marty Bender, a deputy police chief who left council at the end of 2015, the bill would have ended public funding of the position of president of Fort Wayne Firefighters Local 124 and the PBA, along with “time banks” that allow members to perform union activities during work hours without a loss of pay.“I will bring it up, and we can bring the ordinance back with five votes,” Crawford said. City spokesman John Perlich declined to comment on York’s status. “We’re not going to speculate on ‘what-if’ questions until we see what formal cuts are presented later this month,” he said. ‘Chronic problem’ properties bill delayed While council may be reconsidering old issues today, it won’t take up the issue of so-called “chronic problem” properties for another month or so to allow more time to meet with affected groups and review related legal issues.“The administration hadn’t bothered to talk to stakeholders like Realtors or the Apartment Association,” said President Russ Jehl, who said some expressed concerns the bill could run afoul of federal fair-housing laws. Perlich said the meetings with stakeholders have been productive so far. “We’ve heard a lot of support, particularly from neighborhoods, for the ordinance. The decision to hold discussion until next month seems to be more of a scheduling issue, due to the busy month of October with the budget, than concerns about the ordinance.” The Fort Wayne Police Department proposed the ordinance to increase its ability to deal with residential and commercial properties that generate numerous nuisance calls. York said 12 or more valid complaints within a 90-day period could allow the property to be designated a chronic problem, exposing owners to possible civil penalties.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"rusty york","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"rusty york john crawford","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"eric lahey","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"marty bender","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"russ jehl","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"john crawford","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"crawford","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"henry","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"perlich","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom henry","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"rusty","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"steve reed","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"york","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"john perlich","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"fort wayne","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"city council","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ipfw","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"apartment association","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"the news-sentinel","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"city light electric","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"fort wayne police department","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"pba","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"reed","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lahey","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"york","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:51:54.876+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"49b40d2efec258ddefcbf153fff09ad715106bcf","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wuIMIFSwXbTvDa4fxkj7pDKJ7uiXsaoksauPKqnIEs4A","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"UPDATE 1-Rebels repel Aleppo assault as air strikes persist","title_full":"UPDATE 1-Rebels repel Aleppo assault as air strikes persist","published":"2016-10-04T16:51:56.313+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.637,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"49b40d2efec258ddefcbf153fff09ad715106bcf","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wuIMIFSwXbTvDa4fxkj7pDKJ7uiXsaoksauPKqnIEs4A","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:51:56.313+03:00","title":"UPDATE 1-Rebels repel Aleppo assault as air strikes persist","text":"UPDATE 1-Rebels repel Aleppo assault as air strikes persist Updated: October 4, 2016 — 9:18 AM EDT Share \n* Rebels say they repel ground offensive south of Aleppo \n* Russian and Syrian warplanes press ahead with bombing of besieged areas \n* Russian embassy hit by mortars on Monday (Adds shelling of Russian embassy, detail) \nAMMAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Rebels said on Tuesday they had repelled a Syrian army offensive in southern Aleppo as Russian and Syrian warplanes continued to pound residential areas in besieged parts of the city where thousands of civilians are trapped. \nThey said they inflicted losses on pro-government fighters after several hours of clashes on the fringe of Sheikh Saed district, at the southern edge of the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo city. \n\"We repelled their attempt to advance in Sheikh Saed and killed 10 regime fighters and destroyed several vehicles,\" said a fighter from the Failaq al-Sham rebel group who gave his name as Abdullah al-Halabi. \nPro-government media said the Syrian army was pressing ahead in a major campaign supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power to take full control of the divided northern Syrian city after a ceasefire collapsed last month. \nThe army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties. \nIn the 15 days since the collapse of the ceasefire, war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented the deaths of 293 civilians in besieged east Aleppo as a result of air strikes and shelling. \nIt documented 25 deaths in government-held west Aleppo as a result of rebel shelling. \nAnother rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army had opened several fronts simultaneously since the launch of a ground assault in order to stretch rebel forces, and had dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender. \nAfter securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp. \nIt took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. \"They leveled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,\" the Zinki commander said. \nRebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move towards the Shuqif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave. \nThat would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids. \n\"The battles inside the city's districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,\" said Halabi. \nIn the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighborhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented 20 deaths from shelling and air strikes on rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Tuesday. \nState television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday. State media said rebel-shelling into a university complex in government-held Aleppo had killed one and injured eight. \nIn the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba. \nRUSSIAN EMBASSY HIT \nThe Russian embassy in Damascus was hit by mortar fire on Monday, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. \nAccording to the statement, two mortar shells exploded near the embassy and another hit the area close to an apartment block on the mission's territory. \n\"It was by chance that none of the embassy employees were injured,\" the statement said. \nThe Russian foreign ministry said the shells had been fired from the Jobar neighborhood east of Damascus. Jobar is controlled by rebel groups Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and Failaq al-Rahman and mortars fired from there occasionally reach central Damascus. \nThis is not the first time this year shells have fallen around the embassy. \n\"We see the shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria as the result of actions of those, who like the U.S. and some of their allies, provoke the continuation of the bloody conflict in Syria by flirting with militants and various kinds of extremists,\" the Russian ministry added. \nSeparately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that the Russian air force would continue to support Syrian government troops and that what he called the \"war on terror\" would continue. \nZeid, a former Security Council president, was not advocating abolishing the veto, but lifting it for very serious cases of international crimes, his spokesman Rupert Colville said. \n\"Look at Aleppo, look what's happening. I think you will never have a more compelling case for something serious, action to be taken,\" Colville told a U.N. briefing. \nRussia is highly unlikely to accept any constraint on its U.N. veto power, which together with its military involvement on the side of President Bashar al-Assad has given it formidable leverage in the Syria crisis, frustrating the United States. \nBANNED BY TREATY \nZeid said that dropping indiscriminate incendiary weapons in heavily populated areas was particularly concerning, as well as being banned by a treaty that Russia is bound by. \nHe compared Aleppo to the World War Two battles of Warsaw, Stalingrad and Dresden, and said calling the enemy a \"terrorist organization\" was not an excuse to ignore the laws of war. \nThe rebels' use of inaccurate \"hell-fire cannons,\" homemade mortars that fire gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel, was also totally unacceptable, he said. \nWorld Health Organization spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said that between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2, 342 people had been killed in eastern Aleppo, including 106 children, and 1,129 had been wounded, including 261 children. \nThose figures were based on reports from functioning health centers and the true figures were probably much higher, she said. \n\"As of yesterday, we have now only six partially functional hospitals that are in service, only one hospital that offers trauma care services,\" Chaib told the briefing. \nWHO still hopes to be able to evacuate dozens of wounded and chronically ill from Aleppo, she said. \"We are preparing plans, we are in contact with several hospitals inside and outside the country, but unless there is security and access we cannot move.\" \nThe Syrian government has yet to respond to a U.N. plan for aid convoys in Syria during the month of October, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke said, noting that the last \"cross line\" convoy was on Sept. 25.

Why? To have control of tariff and to have control of safety,\" RTA director-general Mattar al-Tayer told Reuters. \nHe said other ride-hailing services would have to sign similar agreements with the regulator by next March to continue operating. \nThe requirement is a further challenge to Uber in the United Arab Emirates. Its services in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, bordering Dubai, have been suspended since August in an apparent dispute with authorities there. Careem also halted its Abu Dhabi services in late August but resumed them a few days later. \nUber, which has an valuation of around $69 billion, has expanded aggressively to more than 450 cities since 2009, fighting a series of battles with local regulators. \nREGIONAL RIVALRY \nDubai's RTA and Careem did not reveal the pricing details of their deal, but said it would involve no additional costs for customers. Launched in Dubai in 2012, Careem has emerged as Uber's fiercest rival in the Middle East and North Africa, and claims over 4 million registered users. \n\"This does give us access to a much bigger fleet of cars, so we believe it gives us a significant advantage over competitors,\" Careem's co-founder and managing director Mudassir Sheikha said of his deal with the RTA. \nIn a statement to Reuters on Tuesday, Uber said it had been in discussions with the RTA for the last two years on how it could make Uber more available to riders in Dubai. \nIt did not say explicitly whether it would be willing to sign a deal similar to Careem's, but it complained that Dubai's regulations required it to price its rides 30 percent above taxi fares -- a very large gap by international standards. \n\"This has prevented us from offering the same level of service, and long-term solutions, as seen by riders in over 450 Uber cities around the world,\" Uber said. \nA source familiar with the issue said Uber was also concerned by the RTA's plan to set up a platform to integrate data from ride-hailing services in Dubai, which could create security and privacy risks. \nLaunched in Dubai by Sheikha and fellow McKinsey & Co alumnus Magnus Olsson, Careem raised $60 million last November through an investment led by private equity company Abraaj Group. \nThe company counts Saudi Arabia's Al Tayyar Travel Group as its largest investor and has also received backing from STC Ventures, an independently managed venture capital fund that has the Saudi Telecom Company as anchor investor. \nUber, in which a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund bought a $3.5 billion stake in June, said last year that it planned to invest $250 million to expand in the Middle East and North Africa.

State television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday. \nThe army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties. \nAnother rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army opened several fronts simultaneously to stretch the rebel forces, and dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender. \nAfter securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp. \nIt took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. \"They leveled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,\" the Zinki commander said. \nRebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move towards the Shuqayyif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave. \nThat would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids. \n\"The battles inside the city's districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,\" said Halabi. \nIn the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighborhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said. \nIn the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba. \nSeparately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks.

Rebels said on Tuesday they repelled a Syrian army offensive in southern Aleppo as Russian and Syrian warplanes continued to pound residential areas in besieged parts of the city where thousands of civilians are trapped. \nThey said they inflicted losses on pro-government fighters after several hours of clashes on the fringe of Sheikh Saed district, at the southern edge of the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo city. \n\"We repelled their attempt to advance in Sheikh Saed and killed 10 regime fighters and destroyed several vehicles,\" said a fighter from the Failaq al-Sham rebel group who gave his name as Abdullah al-Halabi. \nPro-government media said the army was pressing ahead in a major campaign supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power to take full control of the divided city after a ceasefire collapsed last month. State television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday. \nThe army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties. \nAnother rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army opened several fronts simultaneously to stretch the rebel forces, and dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender. \nAfter securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp. \nIt took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. \"They leveled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,\" the Zinki commander said. \nRebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move toward the Shuqayyif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave. \nThat would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids. \n\"The battles inside the city's districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,\" said Halabi. \nIn the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighborhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said. \nIn the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba. \nSeparately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks. \n(Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi and Tom Perry;

Other board members visible at the board table include Stacey Bliss (next to Hartel), Alice Zaleski (seated at end of table) and (from far right) Emily Phillips and Dave Osentoski. (Photo by Tom Gilchrist) \nCASS CITY — Ron McCollum – called the “lowest-rated” Cass City Public Schools teacher by an administrator when the school board laid him off in August – was called back to work this week in a move hailed as “marvelous” by a teacher union leader. \n“I think it’s marvelous,” said Kris Milligan, a teacher at Cass City Elementary School and president of the Cass City Education Association. \nWhen asked if she has a problem with the job McCollum is doing as a teacher at the elementary school, Milligan said “None.” \nCass City Superintendent Jeff Hartel recommended laying off a teacher at the board’s August meeting due to a 19-student decline in the school district’s preschool “Great Start Readiness Program.” The decline was caused by a change in the way officials calculate family income to determine which students are included in the program for at-risk pupils. \nMcCollum, described by union leaders as a teacher with about 15 years of experience in Cass City, lost his job after the district laid him off instead of any of three teachers in the preschool program: Ashley Copeland, Mandy Haag and Amanda Hartzell. \nUnion officials indicated McCollum had more seniority than one or more of the three preschool teachers, though it wasn’t clear at press time if McCollum – who teaches physical education and technology at the elementary school – had more seniority than each of the trio. \nThe school board called McCollum back to work, though, after Haag declined to accept a full-time position as a preschool teacher, and resigned from the school district. \n“I’m glad to see Ron back at work,” Milligan said. “It’s as it should be.” \nMilligan said Haag took a leave of absence last school year, but turned down a full-time preschool teaching job this school year. \n“(Haag) did not want to take a full-time job,” Milligan said. “In the spring she had indicated she was coming back to work, but the position went from half-time to full-time, and that wasn’t right for her family.” \nIn her letter of resignation accepted Monday by the school board, Haag wrote “Please know that this was an extremely difficult decision for me, but this is what’s best for my family right now.” \nIn August, Hartel said McCollum ranked lowest among Cass City’s 55 teachers, when using evaluations of teachers done by school principals. Teachers receive one of four ratings from administrators: highly effective, effective, minimally effective and ineffective. \n“He was the lowest-rated, the next one (for layoff),” Hartel said after the August meeting. “Seniority is out the door.” \nHartel told the school board Monday that McCollum has been placed under a “strict” individualized development plan, adding McCollum must meet various objectives, including student achievement adjectives. \nHartel said district principals Aaron Fernald and Don Markel are “monitoring (McCollum) daily, weekly and monthly.” \n“I hope he does well,” Hartel said after the meeting. “He’s off to a good start right now and we’re going to give him all the support that we can give him, and we’ll see how he does.” \nWhen asked if McCollum needs to be strictly monitored, Milligan said “I’ve not been in his classroom, but that’s an administrator’s role – if they see there’s problems, they need to identify them and give that person an opportunity to improve themselves.” \nWhen asked if seniority benefits a teacher, Milligan – in her 38th year as a teacher at Cass City – said “I think experience counts for a lot.” \nIn other action Monday, the school board accepted Nick Moyer’s resignation as a paraprofessional at Cass City Junior/Senior High School, as Moyer has accepted a full-time job as a physical education teacher at Ubly Elementary School. Board members also accepted the resignation of Mayra Learman as coordinator of the Student Responsibility Center, which houses students needing to better their behavior to improve academically and stay out of trouble. \nAfter accepting the resignations of Haag, Moyer and Learman, the board hired Laurie Roggenbuck as an elementary-school paraprofessional, and hired Susanne Forster, a paraprofessional, as a part-time teacher. \nTom Gilchrist is a reporter for The Advertiser and can be reached at gilchrist@tcadvertiser.com","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"cass city","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom gilchrist","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"moyer","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jeff hartel","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"kris milligan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"nick moyer","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"laurie roggenbuck","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dave osentoski","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"aaron fernald","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mayra learman","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"haag","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"stacey bliss","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"learman","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"emily phillips","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ron mccollum","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hartel","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mandy haag","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"amanda hartzell","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"don markel","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ron","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mccollum","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"susanne forster","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"alice zaleski","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"milligan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ashley copeland","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"cass city elementary school","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cass city education association","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cass city","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cass city public schools","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cass city junior/senior high school","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ubly elementary school","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"cass city","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:52:36.066+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"f875a46702fdc74dcd6d79e31878b0d436839a62","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wuIMIFSwXbTvDa4fxkj7pDK1AWAYgVs_jvVVRWqTMvgD","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"U.N.'s Zeid warns Russia over Syria air strikes","title_full":"U.N.'s Zeid warns Russia over Syria air strikes","published":"2016-10-04T16:52:37.851+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.21,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"f875a46702fdc74dcd6d79e31878b0d436839a62","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wuIMIFSwXbTvDa4fxkj7pDK1AWAYgVs_jvVVRWqTMvgD","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:52:37.851+03:00","title":"U.N.'s Zeid warns Russia over Syria air strikes","text":"U.N.'s Zeid warns Russia over Syria air strikes Updated: October 4, 2016 — 4:56 AM EDT Share Close icon Reuters \nGENEVA, Oct 4 (Reuters) - United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein warned Russia on Tuesday over the use of incendiary weapons in Syria's besieged enclave of eastern Aleppo, and said crimes by one side did not justify illegal acts by the other. \nZeid said in a statement that the situation in Aleppo demanded bold new initiatives \"including proposals to limit the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council,\" which would enable the U.N.

By end-June 2017 the index is seen steady at 5,550 points, and further up to 5,800 by end-2017. \nWhile that represents a 6 percent gain over the next 15 months, it also amounts to a sideways step from the 5,803 hit in May 2015. \nSince then the prices of oil and iron ore <.IO62-CNI=SI> tumbled - iron falling almost 35 percent and the oil price halved, but both commodities have rallied in 2016, each gaining around 30 percent for the year to date. \nThe two commodities account for half of Australia's exports by dollar value. \n\"The ongoing recovery and stabilization of commodity prices suggests materials will be one sector that will outperform,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. \n\"We're in a subdued positive growth environment. And in that environment sentiment is likely to drive markets and they're likely to fluctuate around that central modestly positive scenario.\" \nIn the broader economy, however, retail sales have been anemic, consumer confidence is falling, and inflation fell in March for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis. \nBut recent data showed Australia's A$1.6 trillion ($1.23 trillion) economy expanded 3.3 percent in the year to June, the fastest pace in four years. \nInvestors will be hoping that the worst is over for Australia's battered resources sector, which has had a tough time since a mining investment boom began to fade in 2014. \nThis year, BHP Billiton Ltd , the world's biggest miner, reported its worst ever loss while rival Rio Tinto Ltd posted its weakest earnings in more than a decade. But both results beat analysts' expectations and the share prices of both companies have risen since. \n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Eric Meijer) More Coverage ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"michael mccarthy","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom westbrook","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"eric meijer","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"reuters","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"rio tinto ltd","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"s&p/asx","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"australian securities exchange","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"u.s. federal reserve","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bhp billiton ltd","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cmc markets","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"britain","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"european union","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"australia","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"sydney","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:52:49.848+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"4de0b0a173b7e1750c897a4f47e9a42eda8cbd27","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wvWumuAAdTaIX4dsxycA_I5HUCzUP3l.ao0LA2e8ZavouNM4hqSfDko-","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"RPT-COLUMN-Lead's not dead it's just been sleeping: Andy Home","title_full":"RPT-COLUMN-Lead's not dead it's just been sleeping: Andy Home","published":"2016-10-04T09:00:00.000+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.74,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"4de0b0a173b7e1750c897a4f47e9a42eda8cbd27","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1wvWumuAAdTaIX4dsxycA_I5HUCzUP3l.ao0LA2e8ZavouNM4hqSfDko-","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T09:00:00.000+03:00","title":"RPT-COLUMN-Lead's not dead it's just been sleeping: Andy Home","text":"RPT-COLUMN-Lead's not dead it's just been sleeping: Andy Home Updated: October 3, 2016 — 9:00 PM EDT Share Reuters \n(Repeats with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) \n* http://tmsnrt.rs/2dKJJiO \nBy Andy Home \nLONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Oh...hello! The lead market's just woken up. \nAfter months of dull sideways trading London lead burst into life last week, jumping almost $200 per tonne to hit a 16-month high of $2,157. \nInvestment money is flowing into both the Shanghai and London markets and the latter is experiencing tightening time-spreads thanks to a dominant long position. \nAn outage at Nyrstar's Port Pirie lead smelter in Australia adds a little extra spice just as the lead market gears up for northern hemisphere winter and the boost to demand from \"battery kill\" season. \nBatteries are still the bedrock of the lead market and are going to remain so for the foreseeable future. \nThe world has got excited about lithium thanks to Tesla and other electric vehicle pioneers but all of them still need a traditional 12-volt lead-acid battery to work. \nGraphic on Shanghai lead, price and market open interest: \nhttp://tmsnrt.rs/2dKJJiO \nMONEY MEN ARRIVE... \nFunds are joining in the lead fun on both the London and Shanghai markets. \nUp until the last couple of weeks funds' main interest in the lead market was to treat it as zinc's poor cousin, expressed as a relative value trade with lead being sold and zinc being bought. \nBut that's changed. \nMarket open interest on the Shanghai Futures Exchange's (ShFE) lead contract has surged to over 51,132 lots from 34,000 lots in the middle of September. \nIt's only been higher once before, in August 2014, when it peaked at 54,336 lots. \nThis build in positioning has been accompanied by a price spike to 15,460 yuan per tonne, the highest level since March 2013, suggesting one of those crowd surges that have become the hallmark of Shanghai metals trading. \nWestern fund managers are joining in. Lead is currently exhibiting the largest speculative long positioning among the London Metal Exchange (LME) metals suite, according to broker Marex Spectron. \nAt 34 percent of open interest as of last Thursday, positioning is as bullish it's been since August 2007. \n...AS LONDON SHOWDOWN LOOMS \nThe money men are joining an increasingly crowded room. \nThe LME's market positioning reports show one entity controlling between 30 and 40 percent of available stocks as of the close of business Thursday. \nIncluding cash positions that holding accounts for 50-80 percent of available stocks. <0#LME:WHC> \nTime-spreads have been tightening accordingly. \nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months spread flipped into backwardation at once stage last week before closing on Friday valued at a narrow $2.75 contango. That compares with a $13 contango as recently as mid-August. \n\"Tom-next\" , the shortest-dated spread on the LME, has also been trading in persistent backwardation for the first time since May. \nThe exchange's futures banding report <0#LME-FBR> points to a potential showdown looming on the main October prompt date, Oct. 19. \nThere are two longs facing three shorts. One of the longs is a big one, accounting for 20-30 percent of open interest, nearly 72,000 tonnes at the mid point. \nOne of the shorts is bigger still, accounting for over 40 percent of open interest, or a minimum 115,000 tonnes. \nThat's generated a fair amount of speculation in the London market that the short may be preparing to deliver a significant tonnage of metal into LME warehouses. \nSUPPLY HIT \nThat raises the question as to whether lead's revival is going to be over before it's really begun. \nWhile sister metal zinc has stormed higher this year on the back of mine closures and a tightening supply chain, lead is still in supply surplus, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group. \nBut then there is Port Pirie. \nNyrstar's smelter was knocked out on Sep. 28 by the storm that caused power failures across South Australia. \nThe blast furnace is currently expected to be down for around 6-10 days for repairs with the exact timing of a full restart still to be confirmed. \nThe plant is one of the largest outside of China with annual capacity of 185,000 tonnes of refined lead and although it is being repurposed into what Nyrstar calls a polymetallic processing and recycling center, it remains for now primarily a lead plant. \nA two-week outage would be manageable but if it lasts longer, the hit on lead supply could be significant. \nThe ILZSG's surplus estimate was only 43,000 tonnes in the first seven months of this year with all of that surplus actually arising in China and the rest of the world seen in minor supply deficit. \nSTAYING POWER \nDemand, meanwhile, is expected to heat up as it always does ahead of the winter months, when automotive battery fail rates spike. \nAnd that's the thing with boring old lead. \nWhile lithium and cobalt grab the headlines thanks to the expected boom in electric cars, lead's existing dependence on the battery sector might make it seem vulnerable to the new disruptive technologies being pioneered by the likes of Tesla. \nBut even Tesla still uses lead batteries, much to the frustration of owners expressing surprise in online forums that their battery has failed. \nWhile lithium-ion battery technology is the real power behind both hybrid and electric vehicles, a lead battery is what keeps all the sensors active when the vehicle is switched off. \nLead-acid technology has been around a long time, is well understood and the batteries are almost completely recyclable, a consideration that is only now starting to move up the agenda in the lithium-ion space. \nLead, in other words, is far from being a sunset metal destined to be replaced by newer, more exciting technology. \nWhether its current price revival is sustainable depends a lot on how the long-short positioning plays out in the London market over the coming couple of weeks. \nA major delivery of off-market metal into LME sheds may kill off the current speculative froth and send lead back into hibernation. \nBut even if that happens, it will only be sleeping again. \nLead's not dead baby.

The two suits are supported by NAWR as a means to remove what are in its view unconstitutional wine shipping laws and to level the e-Commerce playing field. “The discriminatory and anti-consumer state laws challenged in the two recently filed lawsuits are the result of state alcohol regulatory systems and legal codes that have been gamed and corrupted by special interests,” said Tom Wark, executive director of the National Association of wine retailers. “It’s notable that the feeble defense lawmakers and alcohol middlemen make on behalf of laws that ban consumers from ordering wine from out of state retailers hinges on a belief that the laws are constitutional, rather than an explanation of how these laws benefit consumers or the state.”\nThe Illinois lawsuit (Lebamoff Enterprises v. Rauner: Case 16-cv-08607) was filed in the U.S. District Northern District of Illinois. It challenges the state’s law that allows in-state wine retailers to ship wine to Illinois consumers, while barring out of state retailers from doing the same.\nThe Missouri lawsuit (Sarasota Wine Market v. Nixon: Case 16-cv-01515) was filed in the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Missouri on September 23rd and challenges that state’s laws that allow Missouri wine retailers to sell, ship and deliver wine directly to consumers within the state, while prohibiting out-of-state retailers from doing so unless they are located in one of the few states which afford Missouri retailers a reciprocal shipping privilege.\n“Lawsuits and legal action ought always be a last resort in addressing unfair and unjust laws,” noted Wark. “Unfortunately, powerful and protected special interests embedded in the middle of the alcohol regulatory system have for nearly two decades used massive campaign contributions and lobbying efforts to convince lawmakers that protection of their profits is more important than free and fair trade and the consumers’ best interests.”\nThe National Association of Wine Retailers members includes wine merchants from across the country who support a level regulatory playing field fit for a 21st century market place.

The Maine group has budgeted $1 million for its ad spending. \nThe campaigns launch a week after the group Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol in Arizona launched its first blast of TV ads. Voters in California and Nevada will also face ballot questions on the issue this year. \nNevada campaigners plan to begin a TV campaign in the \"very near future,\" a spokesman said. \nBoth the Massachusetts and Maine campaigns face stiff opposition from local officials, with Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, a recovering alcoholic, among the most prominent Democratic voices against the idea. Walsh has stressed the perceived risk that legalizing marijuana could lead users to become addicted first to pot and then other drugs. \nMaine Governor Paul LePage, a Republican, has also repeatedly voiced his opposition. \nRecent opinion polls have shown voters in both northeastern states favoring legalization. Some 53 percent of respondents to a WBZ/UMass Amherst poll of 700 likely Massachusetts voters last month supported the measure. \nThe result in Maine was much the same, with 53 percent of 505 likely voters polled by the Portland Press Herald saying they favored the idea. \nThe Massachusetts group said its initial campaign would last a week with a potential extension. \n\"It's a matter of how much money we have and how much TV we can afford,\" said Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for the group.

But Tom Valenti, a principal with Cameron Group of East Syracuse, N.Y., said he still isn’t giving up on the mixed-use project. Valenti said Monday that he and Wal-Mart officials “mutually agreed that we would move on without them.” He said the developers plan to replace Wal-Mart with two or three other retailers, allowing the project to proceed under a site plan the Mission City Council approved in January. Wal-Mart, which agreed to come to Mission Gateway five years ago, had planned to close its 20-year-old Roeland Park store in conjunction with the opening of the new store. But Delia Garcia, director of communications for Wal-Mart, said the retailer recently decided to stay put in Roeland Park and remodel that store based on problems with the Mission Gateway proposal and research indicating that Wal-Mart investments in staff and existing stores had led to eight straight quarters of same-store sales growth. Valenti said Wal-Mart’s participation in Mission Gateway was probably doomed by the Mission City Council’s 7-1 vote Aug. 17 to reject his latest revised preliminary site plan.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"delia garcia","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom valenti","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"valenti","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"wal-mart","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cameron group","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mission city council","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mission gateway","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"kansas city","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"n.y.","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"east syracuse","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mission gateway","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"roeland park","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:53:35.613+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"39339a51fd55ad2b7f41a07a91aeeace16b76a0d","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg_OgRXocbMZuWtVIsClEFEsMBgvPqPqlWgII5imZvj_jblGnWfHfx93bqZTbq3DaFvVRRF8LgeWMkf_fqhz94fkt9cZVSIWWsVu7hwxI1rOX_jcKatCLMT7aW.oOFlmuS34gzO9fYU0mA--","site_full":"www.pokerforum.ca","site":"pokerforum.ca","site_section":"http://www.pokerforum.ca/f24/","site_categories":[],"section_title":"Royal Cup","title":"Announcing XVIII Nov 12th, 2016; Discussion thread - Page 2","title_full":"Announcing Royal Cup XVIII Nov 12th, 2016; Discussion thread - Page 2","published":"2016-10-03T00:56:00.000+03:00","replies_count":1,"participants_count":5,"site_type":"discussions","country":"CA","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":null,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"242b63da4be86fce4973ee2cb34e2ea244e3da3f","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg_OgRXocbMZuWtVIsClEFEsMBgvPqPqlWgII5imZvj_jblGnWfHfx93bqZTbq3DaFvVRRF8LgeWMkf_fqhz94fkt9cZVSIWWsVu7hwxI1rOX_jcKatCLMT7aW.oOFlmuS3KkY97L8jNf5b5kpNzi9T9UTSvJwA5Ask-","ord_in_thread":1,"author":"The Prophet 22","published":"2016-10-03T02:36:00.000+03:00","title":"","text":"Originally Posted by compuease Prophet22 you are good right?

After months of political wrangling, Congress last week finally approved a little more than half of that to fight the virus. \n\"Because we've had to wait these seven months, we haven't been able to get a running start on some of the critically important studies to understand more fully the impacts of Zika, to establish better diagnostic tests, to improve our way of controlling mosquitoes,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding that vaccine development efforts were also delayed. \nHealth officials on a conference call with reporters also said money they had redirected from other efforts, such as for Ebola and cancer research, was unlikely to be reimbursed. \n\"There's a cost to protecting Americans from the dollars that were reprogrammed,\" Frieden said. \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell promised that the new funds would be allocated quickly. But she said critical time and energy were spent on working to get the funding instead of working to use it. \n\"That money would be out the door if we had received it at the time we asked for it,\" Burwell said. \nAsked for examples of what would not be funded or would be underfunded because Congress approved $800 million less than what was requested, Burwell pointed to hard-hit Puerto Rico. She said $141 million would be earmarked for Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories out of $271 million that had been requested. \nThere are more than 25,000 cases of the mosquito-borne virus in the United States and its territories, including more than 2,300 involving pregnant women. Most of the cases are in Puerto Rico, but there is a limited active outbreak in Miami. \nThe virus, which can also be transmitted through sex with an infected person, has been linked to a variety of serious birth defects, including microcephaly and severe brain abnormalities.

The plot of a movie matters (sort of), but in another way it's just an excuse. Sitting there in the dark, gazing up at the screen, we want to be that clandestine lover, that danger junkie, that grandiose addict-victim, that seeker of crimes of passion. \"The Girl on the Train,\" an adaptation of Paula Hawkins' prismatic but heavy-breathing 2015 bestseller, is at heart a murder mystery, yet in many ways that's the film's most routine aspect. The director, Tate Taylor (\"The Help\"), stages it as a series of voluptuous vignettes in which three women, who all reside in the idyllically posh and leafy New York suburb of Ardsley-on-Hudson, lay bare their forbidden yearnings and secret inner lives. As a big-screen thriller, \"The Girl on a Train\" is just so-so, but taken as 112 minutes of upscale psychodramatic confessional bad-behavior porn, it generates a voyeuristic zing that's sure to carry audiences along. \nThe title character, Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt), is a complete wreck -- and from the start, that's one of the fantasies that's being played out. (You will know what it is to hit rock bottom!) When we meet her, she's riding the train back from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, fixating on a woman she doesn't even know -- Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett), an elegant cornfed blonde standing on the second-floor balcony of her splendid rustic home, just across the train tracks, looking like the woman who has it all. Rachel is the woman who lost it all. She was married to Tom (Justin Theroux), a protective shark, and they were in the middle of launching the perfect suburban existence, but she couldn't get pregnant, and that's when the drinking started. In flashback, the movie shows us tantrums, rages, blackouts, all of which have delivered Rachel to the identity she occupies now: an isolated divorcee, sitting on the train guzzling cheap vodka out of her designer water bottle. She's a pretty far-gone alcoholic, and Blunt, in a perilously effective performance, plays her with a cold, slack woe that makes it look as if her facial features are slowly coming apart. \nRachel has no idea that Megan, the object of her identification, has any connection to her. But oh, are they connected! Everyone in \"The Girl on the Train\" is connected, to the point that the movie has a turbulently incestuous small-town-soap-opera quality. Think \"Peyton Place\" as staged by the Adrian Lyne of \"Fatal Attraction.\" It may be intentional that the characters even kind of look alike. Megan, a former fixture on the art-gallery scene, with an untamed wild streak (and therefore bored as hell as a trophy wife in the 'burbs), has been working as a nanny for Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), who has the same angelic locks and confectionary skin tone. It's part of the film's deadpan if not quite satirical vision that they seem to belong to the same tribe of postfeminist Stepford princesses. \nAnna is the woman who stole Rachel's husband (she's living the life Rachel wanted to), and it has driven Rachel cuckoo with self-hatred. Blunt's performance is a masochistic revel, but she's such a tender and lyrical actress that she makes even Rachel's lowball actions sympathetic. We can't help but root for her, even when she seems to be a drunken destroyer with borderline personality disorder. At one point, she stands in a bathroom, smearing the mirror with lipstick, letting out the rage she feels at her ex-, and it's a cathartic moment. \nTaylor did a superb job of directing \"The Help,\" using his sympathetic identification with the women on screen to save it from being just another racial message movie, and here, working from a script by the kink-friendly Erin Cressida Wilson (\"Secretary\"), and utilizing the radiant close-up cinematography of Charlotte Bruus Christensen, he shows a similar impulse. \"The Girl on the Train\" is sexy, brutal, diary-of-a-mad-housewife trash made with a distinctive creamy classy empathy. When Megan announces that she has landed a gallery job and needs to quit her nanny position that day, leaving Anna and her baby in the lurch, the two of them get into a tense exchange about the hidden perils of being a stay-at-home mom, and this has to be the first contempo noir that features a deep-dish dialog about that. It's a scene that resets the stakes. \n\"The Girl on the Train\" is grounded in the tranquil house-beautiful fetishism of the Hudson Valley suburbs, to the point that you sometimes feel you're watching \"Pottery Barn Catalogue: The Movie.\" For a while, though, we seem to be trapped in a spin on \"Fatal Attraction\" in which the aggrieved feminine stalker is the heroine. How badly does Rachel act? She sneaks into her tastefully exquisite former home, where Tom and Anna now live (it's the paradise she was kicked out of), and coddles their infant in the backyard, pretending it's the child she couldn't have. She drinks like a homeless derelict, inviting the stares of passengers on the train. And, in fact, she nearly is homeless: She's been crashing for two years on a spare bed offered by a friend, and the reason she joins the commuter horde traveling into Manhattan each morning has nothing to do with the PR job she once held. Everything snaps when she oversees the mysterious Megan kissing a stranger, betraying her husband. Just like Rachel was betrayed! Shortly after that, she returns late at night, only now she's a mess, her hair and clothing caked with blood and mud. On that very night, Megan goes missing. Rachel, of course, has blacked out what happened, but she's haunted by an image of herself approaching Megan, raising a weapon... \nAs a novel, \"The Girl on the Train\" is told by a series of unreliable narrators, and that's part of its post-\"Gone Girl\" fragmentary anomie. It's a structural gambit that carries a whiff of ideology, a sense of women being forced to live divided and tattered lives. In the movie, the unreliability factor plays differently. It comes down to this: We're shown a bunch of stuff, and we therefore believe it, but the stuff we're shown may not, in fact, have happened. It's not all that different from what the book did, yet somehow, in a movie, it comes off as more of a cheat. The audience feels like it's been played. From what's presented, it appears highly possible that Rachel is guilty of murder, but that's partly because the local cops, led by a detective played by the always acerbically sharp and appealing Allison Janney, seem better at random hunches than they are at forensics. \nBlunt, who plays half her scenes looking like she's holding back tears (or maybe screams), is a luminous actress who's been in need of a role that allows her to get past her slight decorousness, and this is that role. It should, at last, elevate her star. \"The Girl on the Train\" gets less convincing as it goes along -- the climax, which features a man, two women, and a kitchen utensil, is borderline camp -- yet the movie has just enough intrigue, and has been made with enough craft, to disguise (for a while) the late-night cable-thriller mechanics it ultimately succumbs to. It delivers a sense of hidden dark lives, which is why it should have no trouble connecting at the box office. Put in demographic terms, a movie like this one fills an essential niche for women moviegoers, and they will likely revel in every sneaky, lurid moment of it. But that same audience should also realize that it ultimately deserves better than decently executed female-gaze victimization pulp.

Updated: October 3, 2016 — 3:37 PM EDT Share LAURAN NEERGAARD The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - More federal money finally is available to fight Zika, even as the news worsens. Babies who at first seem to have escaped the virus' devastating hallmark defect - an abnormally small head at birth - might not be out of the woods after all. \nBrazilian doctors have counted a small number of babies who at birth had a normal-sized head and only later were found to have problems. They have delayed neurodevelopment. At 5 months, one could use one hand but not the other. Later on, some even developed that defect, called microcephaly. The brain and skull weren't growing properly after birth, instead of before. \n\"Microcephaly is only the tip of the iceberg, only the thing we see when the baby is born,\" Dr. Vanessa Van der Linden, a pediatric neurologist in Recife, Brazil, told a meeting at the National Institutes of Health where she outlined a long list of Zika-related abnormalities. \nTo children's health experts, the message is clear. Intense study is needed of babies born to Zika-infected mothers to learn the range of health problems they may face. \n\"It is just critical to evaluate the entire child. Even in the child who does not have microcephaly, that doesn't mean no evaluation is needed,\" said Dr. Catherine Spong of the NIH's National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which despite budget constraints has begun research to better understand the full range of abnormalities they may face. \n\"Some will be apparent at birth, but likely some will not be,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Monday. He called \"the biggest unknown\" what will happen to those babies who don't have an obvious abnormality at birth. \nAfter months of partisan bickering, Congress last week passed a budget bill that includes $1.1 billion to address the Zika crisis. It's just over half the total emergency money that President Barack Obama requested last February. That was well before cases in U.S. states and territories rose to more than 25,000, and well before mosquitoes started spreading the virus in Florida's Miami-Dade County. \nFederal health officials said Monday they'd race the money to the researchers and state health departments that need it as soon as possible. \nTopping the list: A Zika vaccine. An initial safety study of one vaccine candidate enrolled its final participant over the weekend, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's infectious disease chief. If follow-up of those participants shows the vaccine was safe and triggered an appropriate immune response, a larger study to test if it really protects is set to begin in January, maybe late December. \nOther priorities include mosquito control, development of faster Zika tests, and hunting possible treatments. \nOut of money to fight Zika over the spring and summer, the government had raided funds meant for other diseases - Ebola, malaria, tuberculosis, even cancer and heart disease - to get started. \nBut it wasn't enough, said CDC's Frieden: \"We haven't been able to get a running start.\" \nNor has Congress refunded the plundered money, meaning work against those other diseases also was delayed. \nAt the recent NIH meeting, Brazil's Van der Linden catalogued a sobering list of abnormalities in the most severely affected babies at her clinic, the ones born with microcephaly - which by itself can't indicate the degree of underlying brain damage. \nShe showed videos of those babies having seizures. They tend to cry nonstop. They may not eat enough - only about an ounce of milk at a time - because of painful reflux and trouble swallowing. Their muscles are stiff and spastic. They have vision and hearing problems. \nIf that isn't worrisome enough, Van der Linden then highlighted less severe problems that appeared later among about a dozen babies who'd appeared healthy at birth. Dr. Carmen Zorrilla of the University of Puerto Rico added that she's seen eye problems among a handful of babies born without microcephaly. \nHow many babies might be at risk from Zika?

After months of political wrangling, Congress last week finally approved a little more than half of that to fight the virus. \n\"Because we've had to wait these seven months, we haven't been able to get a running start on some of the critically important studies to understand more fully the impacts of Zika, to establish better diagnostic tests, to improve our way of controlling mosquitoes,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding that vaccine development efforts were also delayed. \nHealth officials on a conference call with reporters also said money they had redirected from other efforts, such as for Ebola and cancer research, was unlikely to be reimbursed. \n\"There's a cost to protecting Americans from the dollars that were reprogrammed,\" Frieden said. \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell promised that the new funds would be allocated quickly. But she said critical time and energy were spent on working to get the funding instead of working to use it. \n\"That money would be out the door if we had received it at the time we asked for it,\" Burwell said. \nAsked for examples of what would not be funded or would be underfunded because Congress approved $800 million less than what was requested, Burwell pointed to hard-hit Puerto Rico. She said $141 million would be earmarked for Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories out of $271 million that had been requested. \nThere are more than 25,000 cases of the mosquito-borne virus in the United States and its territories, including more than 2,300 involving pregnant women. Most of the cases are in Puerto Rico, but there is a limited active outbreak in Miami. \nThe virus, which can also be transmitted through sex with an infected person, has been linked to a variety of serious birth defects, including microcephaly and severe brain abnormalities.

She said the retirees deserve their day in court, and questioned the wisdom of applying equitable mootness to municipal bankruptcies. \n\"I fear that using such a justification to brush aside the retirees' legal claims will leave them with the impression that their rights do not matter,\" Moore wrote. \nJamie Fields, a lawyer for many retirees who challenged the pension cuts, said his clients may ask the full appeals court to reconsider the decision. \n\"Being a split decision, I feel somewhat vindicated,\" he said in a phone interview. \"I think we were on good legal footing.\" \nLawyers for Detroit did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Tom Brown) More Coverage ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"david gregorio","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"alice batchelder","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bernard friedman","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"moore","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom brown","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"friedman","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jamie fields","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"karen nelson moore","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jonathan stempel","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"6th u.s. circuit court of appeals","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"reuters","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"cincinnati","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"detroit","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"new york","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"u.s.","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:53:51.518+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"8bff05c7335c8ee59f5a95e43cf247bd13081692","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh3GGn3nZR6warms3ea882M7m8eFdQBemnri0KXQbdEECgJffCgNG7ReWSfMQVr_DvWtENqWUODne2Id85Fh5qwGt1BE_VG68J81jZhQfyjxfjLgDPhYGKZHCGaMmvloiv0X_pN0sTwkkurvkPHQk7RtZh0Ymvo0w9Q--","site_full":"www.dailystar.co.uk","site":"dailystar.co.uk","site_section":"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/rss/168/Travel/","site_categories":["news","entertainment","sports"],"section_title":"Daily Star | Travel News Feed","title":"The craziest Disneyland stories that are actually TRUE","title_full":"The craziest Disneyland stories that are actually TRUE","published":"2016-10-04T16:53:51.536+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"blogs","country":"GB","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://cdn.images.dailystar.co.uk/dynamic/28/photos/236000/173x216/662236.jpg","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":4425,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"8bff05c7335c8ee59f5a95e43cf247bd13081692","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh3GGn3nZR6warms3ea882M7m8eFdQBemnri0KXQbdEECgJffCgNG7ReWSfMQVr_DvWtENqWUODne2Id85Fh5qwGt1BE_VG68J81jZhQfyjxfjLgDPhYGKZHCGaMmvloiv0X_pN0sTwkkurvkPHQk7RtZh0Ymvo0w9Q--","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:53:51.536+03:00","title":"The craziest Disneyland stories that are actually TRUE","text":"DISNEYLAND/INSTAGRAM MAGIC: Did you know these myths were actually true? \nIt’s known as the happiest place on Earth but Disneyland has many mysterious stories surrounding it. \nFrom secret basketball courts to fainting staff, these are the tales that have been circulating for years – and they're actually true. \n1.

It was the fourth month of year-over-year sales declines so far this year. \nAutomakers reported mixed results Monday. Nissan's sales rose 4.9 percent over last September. Hyundai and Subaru reported 4-percent sales gains, while Toyota's sales rose 1.5 percent. General Motors' and Honda's sales were flat for the month. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 1 percent. Ford and Volkswagen both reported 8-percent declines. \nSlowing sales aren't necessarily bad news for automakers or consumers. Sales remain near historic highs, and some analysts suggest 2016 sales could still top the record of 17.5 million set last year. Favorable conditions such as low interest rates and low gas prices remain in place. Consumer confidence hit a nine-year high in September, according to the Conference Board's index. \nBut after six straight years of growth, demand is clearly slowing. U.S. sales are up just 0.5 percent through September. \nCars have been particularly hard hit as low gas prices have made SUVs and trucks even more appealing. Brands without competitive new SUVs are struggling; Fiat, for example, saw its sales plummet 30 percent last month. \nNew cars also are feeling pressure from used cars because of the growing popularity of leasing. More than 30 percent of new vehicles are now leased, up from 20 percent five years ago. Around 500,000 off-lease vehicles are returning to the used car market this year and next year, and many consumers will choose them instead of new vehicles, says Alec Gutierrez, a senior market analyst with Kelley Blue Book. \nThat has automakers pushing harder for sales. Incentive spending hit a record of $3,923 per vehicle last month, surpassing the previous high set in December 2008 during the recession. \nBMW was offering $6,732 in incentives per vehicle in September, up 44 percent from a year ago, according to TrueCar.com. Fiat Chrysler spent $4,302 per vehicle on deals, up 23 percent. Buyers could get $4,500 cash back on a 2016 Ford Escape or $2,000 on a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu. \nMark LaNeve, Ford's U.S. sales chief, said incentive spending was $430 per vehicle higher than last September. Usually, he said, incentives are only about $100 higher or lower than the year before. \n\"The business is as competitive as I've seen in my 32 years,\" LaNeve said during a conference call with analysts and media. \"Everybody's trying to protect their share and, in spots, grow it.\" \nAmong the sales tallies from automakers: \n- General Motors Co.'s sales fell less than 1 percent to 249,795. Buick sales jumped 14 percent thanks to strong sales of the new Envision small SUV and Cadillac sales rose 3 percent as the new XT5 SUV and CT6 sedan hit the market. But Chevrolet sales were flat and GMC sales fell 9 percent. \n- Ford Motor Co.'s sales fell 8 percent to 204,447. The company said a planned 36-percent cut in sales to low-profit rental car companies was partly to blame. Ford's car sales plummeted 21 percent compared to last September, led by a 39.5 percent decline for the subcompact Fiesta. F-Series truck sales also fell 3 percent as Ford prepared to launch its new Super Duty trucks. Lincoln sales were up 1 percent. \n- Toyota Motor Co.'s sales rose 1.5 percent to 197,260. The company's car sales were down 9 percent. Sales of the hybrid Prius fell 23 percent, a victim of low gas prices. But SUV and truck sales were up 13 percent. \n- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said its sales fell 1 percent to 192,883. Ram sales jumped 29 percent on strong sales of the Ram pickup and ProMaster van, but sales declined for the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Fiat and Alfa brands. \n- Honda Motor Co.'s sales fell less than 1 percent to 133,655. Sales of Honda's new small SUV, the HR-V, were up 49 percent over last year, when it was just hitting the market, but the company's car sales fell 8 percent. Luxury Acura sales were down 13 percent. \n- Nissan Motor Co.'s sales rose 5 percent to 127,797. SUV and truck sales jumped 19 percent; sales of the Rogue small SUV rose 6 percent to more than 26,000, a September record. Luxury Infiniti sales were up 12 percent. \n- Hyundai Motor Co.'s sales rose 4 percent to 66,610. Hyundai's biggest seller, the Sonata midsize sedan, saw sales slip 6 percent, but sales of the Santa Fe SUV were up 5.5 percent. \n- Subaru brand sales rose 4 percent to 54,918, led by a 12 percent gain for the Subaru Outback small SUV. \n- Volkswagen brand sales dropped 8 percent to 24,112. Volkswagen said Tiguan small SUV sales rose slightly but sales of the rest of its vehicles were down as the company continues to feel the effects of a year-old diesel engine scandal.

The two suits are supported by NAWR as a means to remove what are in its view unconstitutional wine shipping laws and to level the e-Commerce playing field. \n\"The discriminatory and anti-consumer state laws challenged in the two recently filed lawsuits are the result of state alcohol regulatory systems and legal codes that have been gamed and corrupted by special interests,\" said Tom Wark, executive director of the National Association of wine retailers. \"It's notable that the feeble defense lawmakers and alcohol middlemen make on behalf of laws that ban consumers from ordering wine from out of state retailers hinges on a belief that the laws are constitutional, rather than an explanation of how these laws benefit consumers or the state.\" \nThe Illinois lawsuit (Lebamoff Enterprises v. Rauner: Case 16-cv-08607) was filed in the U.S. District Northern District of Illinois. It challenges the state's law that allows in-state wine retailers to ship wine to Illinois consumers, while barring out of state retailers from doing the same. \nThe Missouri lawsuit (Sarasota Wine Market v. Nixon: Case 16-cv-01515) was filed in the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Missouri on September 23rd and challenges that state's laws that allow Missouri wine retailers to sell, ship and deliver wine directly to consumers within the state, while prohibiting out-of-state retailers from doing so unless they are located in one of the few states which afford Missouri retailers a reciprocal shipping privilege. \n\"Lawsuits and legal action ought always be a last resort in addressing unfair and unjust laws,\" noted Wark. \"Unfortunately, powerful and protected special interests embedded in the middle of the alcohol regulatory system have for nearly two decades used massive campaign contributions and lobbying efforts to convince lawmakers that protection of their profits is more important than free and fair trade and the consumers' best interests.\" \nThe National Association of Wine Retailers members includes wine merchants from across the country who support a level regulatory playing field fit for a 21st century market place.

She said the retirees deserve their day in court, and questioned the wisdom of applying equitable mootness to municipal bankruptcies. \n\"I fear that using such a justification to brush aside the retirees' legal claims will leave them with the impression that their rights do not matter,\" Moore wrote. \nJamie Fields, a lawyer for many retirees who challenged the pension cuts, said his clients may ask the full appeals court to reconsider the decision. \n\"Being a split decision, I feel somewhat vindicated,\" he said in a phone interview. \"I think we were on good legal footing.\" \nLawyers for Detroit did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Tom Brown) More Coverage ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:53:59.741+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"b51941f37a6ecf9aa33187cbd2d8832cecd1e3ef","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLSPvCwM2y_R5gaLZu66qJCLjCF3eklS4wVGNhNDhbCfLQ--","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"No Brady sightings at Patriots' facility as suspension ends","title_full":"No Brady sightings at Patriots' facility as suspension ends","published":"2016-10-04T05:37:00.000+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.009,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"b51941f37a6ecf9aa33187cbd2d8832cecd1e3ef","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLSPvCwM2y_R5gaLZu66qJCLjCF3eklS4wVGNhNDhbCfLQ--","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Kyle Hightower","published":"2016-10-04T05:37:00.000+03:00","title":"No Brady sightings at Patriots' facility as suspension ends","text":"No Brady sightings at Patriots' facility as suspension ends Updated: October 3, 2016 — 5:37 PM EDT Share KYLE HIGHTOWER The Associated Press \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) - With his four-game \"Deflategate\" suspension completed, Tom Brady was eligible to step back into the New England Patriots' team facility on Monday for the first time in a month. \nBut if he was there, no one was willing to say. \nOnly a handful of Brady's teammates appeared in the locker room after attending position group meetings and none of them acknowledged laying eyes on their quarterback. \n\"I haven't seen him yet,\" receiver and special teams captain Matt Slater said. \n\"No,\" tackle Nate Solder responded when asked if he'd run into No. 12. \nMaybe receiver Chris Hogan happened to catch a glimpse? \n\"I haven't seen him.\" \nWas he on the premises, at least? \n\"I can't answer that question,\" Slater said. \nIt's possible Brady may have not been the building. Though both he and defensive end Rob Ninkovich - whose four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substance ended Monday - were allowed to be back, it's unclear when the team must make room on its 53-man roster to accommodate their returns. \nCoach Bill Belichick was less than forthcoming when he was asked that question during his teleconference Monday morning. \n\"I don't have an exact answer for that right this second,\" he said. \"Why don't you call the league and ask them? I'm sure they have the answers.\" \nThe Patriots announced later that they released TE Clay Harbor. Harbor appeared in three games with New England, mainly on special teams, and did not register any statistics. \nThe players are off Tuesday, so if Brady and Ninkovich haven't been officially activated yet, it appears Wednesday may be the earliest that would take place. \nWhenever it happens, Slater said, the presence of their team leader would be welcomed as the Patriots turn their attention to Sunday's trip to Cleveland. \n\"We know what type of player he's been for this team. We know what type of leader he's been for this team,\" Slater said. \"But all that being said, we all have a job to do with him here now. So we're excited about the challenges that lie ahead.\" \nSolder said having their third different quarterback in the huddle in five games won't affect their preparations. \n\"That doesn't matter because we have a job,\" Solder said. \"We have to block the guys in front of us. It doesn't matter who's behind us. We got to do our job.\" \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower Published: ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:54:00.455+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"939431cafcd383b4a5acd5498f7a95003b2418cf","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg81mVAtOW0xiR90MITj3Qz2oNCrsIK8eKw60wO2Ly2jtakvp2zMk1dYKz3VQS4wa38yHIKuOSRIe_wYWhkdyv1uTOUdmdpuufJkrIr6E0am5nvu8RF5OD1R78s2g13PoEktd66eYPzM0xBiedYCOr3DYNBR77WdXn9Yx4AVs13f8XEocfwokzboVHb83eeQXbwtd94NujSPWnD54CzLn3VLIA8l7xijBJs-","site_full":"www.readingchronicle.co.uk","site":"readingchronicle.co.uk","site_section":"http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/readingfc/rss","site_categories":[],"section_title":"Reading Chronicle | Reading FC","title":"Reading FC: Martin Kuhl reflects on a victory in Birmingham for the U23s ahead of tonight's trip to Portsmouth","title_full":"Reading FC: Martin Kuhl reflects on a victory in Birmingham for the U23s ahead of tonight's trip to Portsmouth","published":"2016-10-04T16:54:00.518+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"GB","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/5548973/","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":null,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"939431cafcd383b4a5acd5498f7a95003b2418cf","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg81mVAtOW0xiR90MITj3Qz2oNCrsIK8eKw60wO2Ly2jtakvp2zMk1dYKz3VQS4wa38yHIKuOSRIe_wYWhkdyv1uTOUdmdpuufJkrIr6E0am5nvu8RF5OD1R78s2g13PoEktd66eYPzM0xBiedYCOr3DYNBR77WdXn9Yx4AVs13f8XEocfwokzboVHb83eeQXbwtd94NujSPWnD54CzLn3VLIA8l7xijBJs-","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:54:00.518+03:00","title":"Reading FC: Martin Kuhl reflects on a victory in Birmingham for the U23s ahead of tonight's trip to Portsmouth","text":"Have you got a local story, picture or video you would like to send to us?

Services Reading FC: Martin Kuhl reflects on a victory in Birmingham for the U23s ahead of tonight's trip to Portsmouth Reading Under 23s boss, Martin Kuhl. 0 comments \nREADING FC U23s got off to a winning start in the Premier League Cup with a 3-1 victory away to Birmingham City. \nMartin Kuhl's side clinched three well-deserved points in their first fixture in their group on a west Saturday in Solihull. \nRoyals got off to a blistering start when Andy Rinomhota fired them ahead in the first minute. \nDominic Samuel flicked on a Zak Jules clearance and attacking midfielder Rinomhota raced through to score. \nThe lead lasted only five minutes as Birmingham levelled when Corey O'Keeffe beat the offside trap before sliding the ball past keeper Stuart Moore. \nBut Reading went in front for a second time midway through the first half when 17-year-old Academy scholar Tom McIntyre headed home from a Josh Barrett free-kick. \nIt got even better for Kuhl's side shortly after when Shane Griffin hung up a beautiful cross at the far post for Tyler Frost to head into the net for a 3-1 lead. \nReading were a major thrreat throughout the opening 45 minuets as Barrett and Jake Sheppard also went close and Samuel saw a strong penalty appeal turned down. \nAnd both goalkeepers came into their own after the break, with Moore making a stunning save to deny O'Keepe before Sheppard was thwarted at the other end. \nLuck did go against the Blues when a long-range shot beat Moore but rattled against the crossbar. \nHowever. Royals substitute Harry Cardwell almost grabbed a fourth for the visitors late on when his angled shot drew a fine stop. \nA delighted Kuhl said: “We started very well and controlled large patches of the game. \n“Stuart Moore made three good saves for us, but in possession we were very good. \n“It rained a lot which was great for us because the pitch was quick, which meant we could move the ball. \n“We controlled the tempo of the game really well. Like the first team, we changed one formation for another dependent on what was needed.” \nRoyals have endured mixed fortunes in this competition after being inaugural winners in 2014 only to crash at the first hurdle against Brentford last year. \nA change in format this season means Reading are competing in a group along with Sheffield United, Stoke City and Birmingham City. \nKuhl added: “Birmingham are second in their league and just a point off the top. They beat the likes of Crystal Palace and Cardiff in the last few weeks so we knew we’d be in for a decent game. \n“We’ve been good in this competition – we won it in the first year, and then we got pipped in the semis the next year when we should have gone through. \n“Last year was disappointing because we went out in the first round, but this year is good because it gives us more competitive games so our lads can put pressure on the first-team players.” \nReading: Moore, Sheppard, Griffin, Jules, McIntyre, Bennett, Rinomhota, Frost, Barrett, Novakovich, Samuel. READING U23s are back in action tonight when they travel to Portsmouth in the Checkatrade Trophy. \nThe match at Fratton Park kicks off at 7.45pm. \nThe likes of Joseph Mendes, Dominic Samuel and Tyler Blackett are expected to be named in Martin Kuhl's squad. \nTeenager Andy Rinomhota, signed from nearby AFC Portchester last year, will also feature for the Royals. \nLikely line-up: Jaakkola, Watson, Blackett, Gravenberch, McIntyre, Kelly, Rinomhota, East, Cardwell, Samuel, Mendes.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:54:00.518+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"ddd4fcd3ce2eb3086358a4ab20236a1351a1d0c0","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1whlCJKPc2ciRhYK5.G_ROxcprkYlXYknEMj6UiJs0Nk0","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"'Fantastic Beasts' Makes Magic With Social Media Buzz","title_full":"'Fantastic Beasts' Makes Magic With Social Media Buzz","published":"2016-10-04T05:03:00.000+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.75,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"ddd4fcd3ce2eb3086358a4ab20236a1351a1d0c0","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLQKuPpq8bP1whlCJKPc2ciRhYK5.G_ROxcprkYlXYknEMj6UiJs0Nk0","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Dave Mcnary","published":"2016-10-04T05:03:00.000+03:00","title":"'Fantastic Beasts' Makes Magic With Social Media Buzz","text":"'Fantastic Beasts' Makes Magic With Social Media Buzz Updated: October 3, 2016 — 5:03 PM EDT Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Dave McNary \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Harry Potter spinoff \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" dominated social media buzz surrounding movies last week following its new trailer launch, with more than 62,000 new conversations, according to media-measurement firm comScore. \nThe trailer, launched Sept. 28, highlights Eddie Redmayne starring as Newt Scamander, an eccentric wizard who carries a briefcase full of monsters.

It looked as if he ran into a plate glass window in what was surely the worst decision in the NFL's fourth weekend. \nJones laid a clean hit on Newton near the goal line that staggered the league's reigning MVP and sent him out of Carolina's 48-33 loss with a concussion. \nIt was reminiscent of Tebow's ill-fated dart into the end zone on the final play of his NFL preseason debut in 2010 when two defenders rendered the rookie a human sandwich with bruised ribs. \nThat was a foretaste of Tebow's brief pro football career and sparked debate among his supporters and detractors alike over whether he could survive in the NFL if he didn't change his bruising running style. \nNewton might also have to change some things if he's to continue thriving - and surviving - in this league. \nNewton has been a human pinball, getting hit 840 times while either throwing or running since entering the league as the NFL's top draft pick in 2011, according to ESPN. Second on that list is Russell Wilson with 303 fewer hits. \nNewton's coach, Ron Rivera, complained about officials not protecting his big QB after several helmet-to-helmet shots in the opener at Denver, but he didn't have a problem with Jones' vicious hit. \n\"If I was playing I've had taken the shot,\" Rivera said Monday. \nThe Panthers are the eighth Super Bowl participant since 1990 to start off 1-3 or worse, and only one of those, the 1996 Cowboys, recovered to reach the playoffs. \nThere were other curious calls in Week 4, such as the Buccaneers keeping Jameis Winston in the game after a 90-minute storm delay for the final few minutes of Tampa Bay's 27-7 loss to Denver . \nNot only that, but they went for it on fourth-and-43 on their final snap after the Broncos had hammered Winston on his previous three snaps. The rag-dolled QB got the ball off quickly and avoided his 27th hit of the afternoon. \nBefore the weather delay, the Bucs, trailing by 20, had punted on fourth-and-6 from the Denver 46. \n\"I'd been watching our offense the whole game. I don't know why anyone expected we could make it on fourth-and-7 if they'd been watching our offense,\" Bucs coach Dirk Koetter said. \"I sure didn't expect us to.\" \nSo, why was Winston in the game at the end and why was he throwing on fourth-and-forever from his 30 with less than two minutes left? \n\"There's definitely a fine line, but you can't take your whole team out,\" Koetter said. \"You don't have enough guys. You can't take everybody out. We thought about it. We had plenty of time to think about it. We left him in.\" \nWashington cornerback Josh Norman was penalized for \"shooting a bow and arrow,\" after he celebrated his crucial interception against Cleveland by acting as if he was Katniss Everdeen. \nThe Patriots failed to greet Tom Brady's return with an undefeated record after Cyrus Jones made the mistake of returning Buffalo's first two kickoffs out of the end zone. \nThat put third-string QB Jacoby Brissett in a bad spot and he went three-and-out from his 9 and his 14 sandwiched around LeSean McCoy's 7-yard TD grab that was all the Bills needed on their way to handing the Pats their first home goose egg since 1993 . \nIn that same game, referee Pete Morelli accidentally broadcast a profanity at Gillette Stadium. Morelli didn't realize he had left his stadium microphone on during a third-quarter timeout and was talking to another official. \nThose at the stadium - but not at home - heard him say, \"Turned into a pretty good game. But one big hit, this s--- could explode.\" \nAmong the many good calls Sunday, one stands out: The Seattle Seahawks visited the Meadowlands for the first time since crushing the Broncos 43-8 in the Super Bowl three years ago. So, coach Pete Carroll booked the same hotel the 'Hawks stayed in that week. The good vibes carried over into Sunday when Seattle beat the Jets 27-17. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nAP Sports Writers Charles Odom and John Wawrow contributed. \n___ \nFollow AP Pro Football Writer Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton Published: ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:54:01.601+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"6ae445a55134a52a82b780ceae42fc88f73e2f59","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZTgGnLng7nGOOP8YaXNd12VBIkrJheIh6TQMC31GYI54dLliXB0O79WMbf00jDXKOafSCawMfSx9Na_UWJ6I1516AR4HoIRYwjjrJe5d8r1_C2MW60SS6PpsGfL1Q0BICfn.n8Itahsgfxz9KhnLf2g","site_full":"www.antiwar.com","site":"antiwar.com","site_section":"https://www.antiwar.com/blog","site_categories":["education"],"section_title":"Antiwar.com Blog","title":"More Media B.S. – OMG, Trump Company Legally Rented Office Space to Iranian Bank!","title_full":"More Media B.S. – OMG, Trump Company Legally Rented Office Space to Iranian Bank!","published":"2016-10-04T16:54:09.797+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":1,"site_type":"blogs","country":"US","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":null,"performance_score":0,"domain_rank":48959,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"6ae445a55134a52a82b780ceae42fc88f73e2f59","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZTgGnLng7nGOOP8YaXNd12VBIkrJheIh6TQMC31GYI54dLliXB0O79WMbf00jDXKOafSCawMfSx9Na_UWJ6I1516AR4HoIRYwjjrJe5d8r1_C2MW60SS6PpsGfL1Q0BICfn.n8Itahsgfxz9KhnLf2g","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Peter Van Buren","published":"2016-10-04T16:54:09.797+03:00","title":"More Media B.S. – OMG, Trump Company Legally Rented Office Space to Iranian Bank!","text":"Once again a story that Trump did nothing illegal is somehow front page news. His crime this time? Continuing to legally rent out office space to a bank already in a building he bought 18 years ago.\nSo the big news is that Donald Trump’s real estate organization rented space to an Iranian bank later linked to Iran’s nuclear program.\nBank Melli, one of Iran’s largest state-controlled banks, was already a tenant in 1998 when Trump purchased the General Motors Building, above, in Manhattan, but he kept them on for another five years, until 2003.\n\nQuick summary:\nThere is no evidence and it is highly unlikely that Trump himself knew every one of the hundreds of tenants in a building he bought in 1998. In fact, the building occupies a full city block, with 1,774,000 net leasable square feet (the bank rented 8,000 square feet.) U.S. security authorities allowed Bank Melli to legally operate offices in the U.S., so renting to them is not a story. Bank Melli was prohibited from conducting bank transactions in the U.S., and did not conduct transactions, but kept an office in New York in hopes sanctions might one day be eased. Bank Melli operated fully in the open. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could have shut them down at any time, or sanctioned Trump for dealing with them if it wished. It did not. The bank itself (not Trump) was only sanctioned by Treasury in 2007, four years after it left Trump’s building. However, the Huffington Post helpfully notes (emphasis added) “[Unnamed] Experts told the Center for Public Integrity that the bank likely supported proliferation activity and Iran’s military years before the Treasury Department publicly condemned the bank,” something the owners of the rental building presumably should have been aware of somehow. The Center for Public Integrity reveals on its website that the Bank Melli “as being controlled by the Iranian government ” since 1999. Actually in its own publically available history, the Bank notes it served as the nation’s central bank, issuing currency, from 1931 . While the media is enjoying this story, it ignores the broader picture. Despite sanctions and trade embargoes, over the past decade the United States government allowed American companies to do billions of dollars in business with Iran and other countries blacklisted as state sponsors of terrorism.\nAt the request of companies from Kraft Food and Pepsi to some of the nation’s largest banks, the Treasury Department across multiple administrations granted some 10,000 licenses for deals involving sanctioned countries.\nThe media is so full of sh*t on these stories their eyes are brown.\nPeter Van Buren blew the whistle on State Department waste and mismanagement during Iraqi reconstruction in his first book, We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People .

(AP) - An emergency relief fund created in 2008 to help New Hampshire dairy farmers was never funded, but state officials said Monday they want to get money to farmers struggling with low milk prices and drought conditions by December. \nNineteen of the state's 120 dairies have closed in recent months. The state had lost 10 dairies over the previous four years combined. \nNew Hampshire's agriculture commissioner, Lorraine Merrill, said it's time to \"stop the hemorrhaging.\" \n\"We've been losing dairy farms at an accelerated pace, and we know that we have a number of them that are really kind of perched on the edge of a cliff at this point, getting bids from cattle dealers on how much they would get for their herds,\" Merrill said. \nAn oversupply of milk in the United States and around the world has caused milk prices paid to farmers to fall below production costs for months, but the drought makes the situation worse for some farmers. In New Hampshire, officials said, milk prices for farmers are 38 percent lower than a couple of years ago and farmers lost about $7 million last year. \nDairy farmers in much of New Hampshire and parts of Massachusetts and New York have been hit hardest by the drought, producing low amounts of hay and corn feed for their cows to get them through the winter. But unlike New Hampshire, those other states and others in New England provide supplemental aid. \nAt a milk fund board meeting on Monday, Tom Marston, who runs a nine-generation dairy farm in Pittsfield, reflected on keeping his farm and others going for the next generation. \n\"I don't want to be the one in charge when it has to go by the wayside,\" he said, calling for immediate aid. \nIn 2007, the state gave dairy farmers a one-time emergency payment of about $2 million for low milk prices, lessening the need for help once the fund was created a year later. \nSince then, the state Department of Agriculture has included money for the Milk Producers Emergency Relief Fund in past budgets, but it didn't make it into final budget recommendations to legislators. \nThe board said it plans to come up with an amount by next week and help create a task force of legislators to hold a hearing on the proposal. It said the goal is to get the money to farmers by the time the Legislature is sworn in Dec. 7. \n\"Some of these farmers aren't going to make it to Christmas,\" said Republican Rep. Bob Haefner, of Hudson, chairman of the fund's board. \nDemocratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has committed $2 million per year to the fund in the next budget, but the money would have to be approved by legislators next year. \nDairy farmer Allen Smith, of Great Bay Farm in Greenland, said people are looking at loans or selling off some animals to pay to feed others. He said he has sold some of his heifers to get enough money to buy feed. \n\"Everybody's like, 'You can get disaster loans,'\" said Smith, whose farm has been around for six generations. \"We've got enough debt. We don't need more loans. You need to fix the price of milk somehow, but that's even a harder option.\" \nFarmers are looking to bring in hay and corn feed from other states, which comes with expensive trucking costs. \n\"You add that to these low milk prices, you end up with a perfect storm,\" said Dorothy Perkins, a food and agriculture extension field specialist at the University of New Hampshire. \"You don't have the money to buy it.\" ","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"smith","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"kathy mccormack","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lorraine merrill","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"merrill","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bob haefner","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom marston","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"maggie hassan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dorothy perkins","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"allen smith","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"legislature","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"department of agriculture","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"associated press","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"university of new hampshire","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ap","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"new hampshire","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"united states","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"greenland","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"new york","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"pittsfield","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"massachusetts","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"concord","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"new england","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"great bay farm","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"n.h.","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hudson","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:54:19.299+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"8758f772ed4b8fba8e97e13b4f87b0df029ae020","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLSKAgrHZXZL2OrNQIrHvvNmof0GZkPF2BrX1hb0hXpG63Hpms8Z7DOMFs2HV7R979k-","site_full":"www.philly.com","site":"philly.com","site_section":"","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"","title":"John Hynes has more speed and Taylor Hall for second season","title_full":"John Hynes has more speed and Taylor Hall for second season","published":"2016-10-04T03:10:00.000+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.203,"main_image":"http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB-2048.png","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":3314,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"8758f772ed4b8fba8e97e13b4f87b0df029ae020","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.ou.sO8L4SDandLG5aUITdzGKD8.t.bLSKAgrHZXZL2OrNQIrHvvNmof0GZkPF2BrX1hb0hXpG63Hpms8Z7DOMFs2HV7R979k-","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Tom Canavan","published":"2016-10-04T03:10:00.000+03:00","title":"John Hynes has more speed and Taylor Hall for second season","text":"John Hynes has more speed and Taylor Hall for second season Updated: October 3, 2016 — 3:10 PM EDT Share TOM CANAVAN The Associated Press \nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) - In taking over the New Jersey Devils last season, John Hynes wanted a team that skated fast and played with discipline and intensity. \nPlay fast, and be hard to play against. It was hockey 101 as taught by the NHL's youngest coach. \nThe Devils improved six points in Hynes' first season and challenged for a playoff spot for much of the season. \nThe system was similar to what Mike Sullivan installed when he took over the Pittsburgh Penguins in December and led them to the Stanley Cup. Sullivan had replaced Hynes at the coach Wilkes-Barre/Scranton after he got the Devils' job. \nThe 42-year-old Hynes more to work with in his second season, both talent and speed. \nThirty-goal scorers Kyle Palmieri and Adam Henrique are back. So is All-Star goaltender Cory Schneider. \nThe biggest addition is Taylor Hall. The 24-year-old left wing was acquired from Edmonton for defenseman Adam Larsson just before free agency started. \nHall gives the Devils the type of top-notch scorer they have not had since Zach Parise left for Minnesota after the 2011-12 season and Ilya Kovalchuk retired and returned to Russia the following year. \n\"You see at the pace at which he plays the game is almost at another level,\" Schneider said of Taylor. \"Again, you don't want to put everything squarely on him to kind of create offense. I think he will.\" \nHynes has seen Hall's offensive skills in every preseason game. He also knows that hockey is a team game. \n\"We want him to play his game within what we are trying to do,\" Hynes said. \"At the same time it's not all about the pressure for him to score. He needs to have a strong group to play with that can assist.\" \nIf the Devils are to get to the playoffs for the first time in five seasons, here are things to watch: \nREPLACING LARSSON: To get Hall, the Devils parted with one of their top defenseman. Larsson and captain Andy Greene were the team's top pair and they matched against the opposition's top line whenever possible. \nFormer Penguin Ben Lovejoy was signed as a free agent and he has a chance to step in with Greene. He can blocks shots and kill penalties. The other option would be Damon Severson. \nKYLE AND ADAM: Palmieri and Henrique had careers seasons with 30 goals last season. The question now is can they do it two years in a row. The other unknown in the offensive game is Mike Cammalleri. He had 14 goals in 42 games before being sidelined for the season with injuries to his right wrist and hand. He's 34-year-old now so coming back from injuries will be tougher. \nZACHA: Pavel Zacha was the Devils' top draft pick in 2015. The center got his first taste of the NHL late in the season and he looked good. He has played well in the preseason but the organization must decide whether to have him play limited minutes in the NHL or to send him to Albany for extensive playing time in the AHL. He is probably good enough to stay. \nSURPRISES: The biggest surprise of training camp might be defenseman Yohann Auvita. The 27-year-old Frenchman was signed to a one-year, two-way contract by the Devils in May after playing most of his professional career in Finland. His offensive skills have reminded some of former Devils defenseman Brian Rafalski. He works hard but has to learn how to play in the NHL's smaller rinks. \nANOTHER PENGUIN: Hynes and general manager Ray Shero have had a habit of bringing in former Penguins.

Picture: TOM O'CALLAGHAN \nMr McNaught is a former farmer and builder. \nHe said the catalyst to become a psychologist was a conversation he had with a woman while he was a builder working in rural Victoria. \nDuring a chat around a kitchen table he learnt one of the woman’s children was stillborn. \n“I asked ‘how was that for you?’ and she said the hardest thing about it was that after the stillbirth people would cross the street so they didn’t have to talk to her,” Mr McNaught said. \n“I asked how her husband felt and she said ‘I dunno, we never talk about it’.” \nMental health events were scheduled to take place on each day of the Elmore Field Days. \nI still have a normal life and I still have PTSD. But now I know what it is and I have the tools to help manage it. - Former police officer Narelle Fraser \nSpeeches and health stalls were organised by Narelle Fraser, who will speak Thursday about the post-traumatic stress disorder she developed while working for Victoria Police’s homicide, rape and missing persons squads. \nShe said despite her reputation for handling tough cases, the work took its toll and several years ago she found herself unable to do the work she loved. \nHowever, with the help of Victoria Police she was able to get help and build a meaningful life as a speaker and teacher. \n“I still have a normal life and I still have PTSD. But now I know what it is and I have the tools to help manage it,” she said. \nIf you are experiencing mental health issues call the Beyondblue support service on 1300 224 636.

We are not all middle to upper class citizens in our 60's who have comfortable jobs. Issues relating to our Youth are many and often debated without a relevant voice in the conversation. As a 26 year old who is in a low income bracket, I can relate to the social and financial pressures the majority of Bendigonians encounter and help identify where we can be smarter in the way we spend rate-payers money. I am also the only candidate in my ward that will have to live with the decisions that I make today, in 40-50 years time. All these factors make my voice relevant for a City of Greater Bendigo Councillor. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nMy biggest strength as a candidate will be how I engage with the community. One of my passions is advocating for the community and bringing down the barriers for communities to achieve their goals. Over the last few years I have concentrated on growing personal relationships with community groups and using my knowledge and fresh perspective to assist them in their needs. The people of the City of Greater Bendigo need to feel the connection with the new council so we can mend the relationship breakdown that is has become. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nIntegrity has to be at the top of the list. Trust and respect has to be earned as a councillor and the quickest way to do so is with integrity. Approachable, honest, down to earth; these all relate to how we communicate. Communication is key to understanding so a councillor needs to have these qualities to be effective in communication. There are many qualities that a councillor need but I feel that it all starts around integrity and communication skills. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \nAlthough councillors are elected by their ward, their responsibility is the City of Greater of Bendigo. All three wards, regional and rural, we are expected to represent everyone. \nWhile we have done a great job in excelling in big builds, we have fallen behind on basic infrastructure in some of our forgotten suburbs and regional area's. I would hope to be apart of a council that will have a revisit the ignored basic needs. \nCompletion of the Canterbury Park precinct needs to be prioritised also. Managing the flora around Lake Tom Thumb, working with the YMCA on the development of a plan around upgrading the Peter Krenz Leisure Center and also completing the Zayden's play space will result in a perfectly executed community hub. \nSupporting our individual communities as they grow. Regional communities such as Woodvale, Goornong and Raywood (to name a few) need ongoing support to ensure they as a community move forward with purpose and can begin development of multipurpose facilities. Similarly but on a bigger scale; supporting Epsom, Huntly and Eaglehawk to take that next step in having a self supporting community that will help assist in living expenses and community spirit. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nMy big passion for Bendigo is culture. Over the last 4 years there have been a lot of contentious issues and it has created a divide. There is too much negativity on both sides of different arguments which only sets us back as a city. I want to see a boost of positivity in our great City through great representation. I believe I can bring faith back into those who represent the people. Some may call me an optimist however if I fail to try then we will try to fail. And I won't let that happen \nIf you were a councillor during the last term, what would you have done differently? For those who served the last term, what would you have done differently? \nI am a firm believer on moving forward in a positive direction. We cannot move forward if we are too busy looking back. Don't get me wrong, its important that we identify our short falls along with our successes so we can improve in our decision makings but it is in the now that we will prove what we can achieve as a community. Unfortunately there are too many candidates with rocks in their hands ready to be thrown instead of having them being put to good use impacting our local communities. \nWe have introduced the green bins to our residences but it hasn't resulted in what we needed to achieve. Although it has alleviated the pressure on the Eaglehawk tip, our city still faces the financial and sustainability issues that we did previously with our waste. Let's look forward to sustainable and smarter outcomes for our City and its people. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nNo, no I haven't. There are a few things that shouldn't be brought into the Council chambers. Councillors ego's, religion and political affiliation should be irrelevant in council discussions. Our community should be at the heart of every decision that is made, anything else should be left at the door. \nWayne Gregson \nI have been a journalist, editor, small business operator, company director, parliamentary electorate officer, heritage/tourism CEO and a Bendigo councillor (2004-08). \nMany of the policies from that term still guide our city, set in place by a council group which knew how to resolve their differences like adults. But so much has been lost in terms of governance and reputation since then. \nI have a long record of standing up for Bendigo, encouraging its potential, laying a framework for investment and jobs. I have been nationally awarded for my services to Bendigo. \nSo much is still to be done, across the city and Whipstick Ward where we need on-going economic and social investment, environmental protection of surviving bushland and promoting pride in our community. \nThe biggest challenges are a loss of self-respect, time and money wasting bickering, and a failure to deliver the outcomes our community expects. \nI was in the National Party while working with Damian Drum, and am proud to say that I had some small part to play in major projects such as the new Bendigo hospital, Ulumbarra Theatre, Aquatic Centre, Canterbury Park developments, Bendigo airport upgrade and the tennis complex upgrade. \nPeter Cox \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nI am standing for Council because I want to see a number of projects completed which I have been directly involved in- \nCanterbury Oval/Lakes Precinct including social club/change rooms, a new regional play space beside Lake Neangar and upgrade of the Peter Krenz Leisure Centre with improved swimming and fitness facilities. \nDevelopment of the Epsom and Eaglehawk Station Precincts and rail services. \nCouncil funding of community facilities at the Epsom Primary School. \nDevelopment of the Botanical Gardens at White Hills and a shared pathway in Iron Bark Gully and the Bendigo Creek. \nI want to use my experience in allocating Council’s $200 million budget so that the city maintains its growth in jobs, housing and great parks while at the same time retaining a cap on rates. I want to introduce an independent office for Mayor and Councillors to provide strong leadership and governance which will allow for Councillors and staff to work more closely together. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nI can offer a wide range of skills to bring about change as I am an experienced manager employing many people during my working life establishing Recycle Shops, Business Incubators and an Inventors Program. I use these skills in deciding budget allocations. I can fluently read financial statements, understand the importance of long term planning while at the same time advocating for individual residents and businesses. I encourage residents to use petitions as a means of getting items on the Council agenda and introduced a regular time slot for organisations to speak directly to Councillors and staff. \nI have introduced regular Ward Meetings to better consult with people, broadcasting of Council meetings on radio, general business agenda item on Council’s weekly meetings so that new policy items can be discussed, a quarterly Finance Committee which involves all Councillors and advocated for an independent review of Council operations which has led to reduced spending in many areas and the ability for Council to support a cap on rates. As a result Council has been able to continue to fund Home and Community Care services, improved library services and to build new recreation facilities. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nBeing able to plan for the future and see Greater Bendigo as it might be in 30 years’ time. \nConcentrate on formulating long term strategies where all sectors, including residents, businesses and farmers understand policy decisions and why they have been introduced. \nHave the ability to allow staff to undertake operations, the day to day tasks and only get involved when there is a complaint or the task has not been implemented in a timely manner. \nUnderstand that Council being the elected representatives are responsible for introducing new strategies and policy and that the CEO’s role and that of staff is to implement that policy. \nIt’s worth noting that you have to get 5 votes out of 9 to introduce a new policy, therefore, it is important to be able to work closely with your colleagues to achieve change. The best change comes about when you are able to research an issue, articulate its importance and either get Councillors to agree or be willing to compromise considering other viewpoints to get the best outcome for the citizens of Greater Bendigo. \nIt’s all about how we do business as a community. Spending other peoples’ money is a very serious responsibility. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \n1. Complete the Canterbury Park/Lakes Precinct master plan with the addition of a regional play space that is creative, innovative and excites people of all ages where they can connect with other people and exercise. This has been a project that has taken 10 years of planning, consultation, debate and implementation and will not only provide great active and passive recreation pursuits but will be a major economic boost and social inclusion initiative for Eaglehawk and the region. It needs to include an upgrade of swimming and fitness facilities at the Peter Krenz Leisure Centre. \n2. Development of the Epsom and Eaglehawk Railway Station precincts to include more efficient train and bus services and the construction of a variety of homes that allow people to experience a 10 minute neighbourhood with all shops and services in close walking or cycling distance. They are ideally placed so we need to make the most of these locations. \n3. Connect parks, schools and shopping centres with shared pathways for walking and cycling. High priorities include off road shared pathways along Bendigo Creek between Golden Square and Huntly, Iron Bark Gully drainage reserve and a route between Lake Weeroona and Lake Neangar. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nI am passionate about Greater Bendigo’s history and heritage. I have been involved in advocating for Bendigo’s history as chairman of Council’s Heritage Advisory Committee over the past 8 years. Bendigo is known for its heritage so it provides an economic boost along with the many stories that give the city its spirit. History demonstrates the city’s inclusiveness and makes it one of the great small cities of the world. We love living here! It provides so much for us all. I am indebted to characters such as David Bannear, Aylene Kirkwood, Daryl McClure, Dennis O’Hoy and Darren Wright and to many others who understand and enjoy Bendigo’s history. Reading about William Vahland and his life gives you drive and motivation. It’s a privilege and very rewarding to be involved. \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nMaintaining a diverse economy which supports small business including the agricultural sector provides the biggest challenge. We have come a long way as back in the 1980’s over 40% of employees were employed by governments which is not sustainable. Today it is about 19% with small business being the major employer. Health care, Retail, Education and Manufacturing sectors provide the biggest employment numbers. Council needs to work with a wide range of organisations including the Bendigo Business Council, Bendigo Manufacturing Group, La Trobe University, Bendigo Bank, Hospitals and the growing Agri-Business sector. The development of a new Industrial Park will be vital over the next 10 years \nHousing diversity is essential as over 50% of our adult population live alone or in couples. Only 27% live as couples with children. Therefore, providing one and two bedroom affordable homes is essential rather than continuing to build 3 and 4 bedroom homes. A compact city rather than a sprawling city is a challenge. \nWe need to see waste as a resource and everybody needs to commit to sorting what they create so the challenge of no more landfills will be overcome. \nIf you were a councillor during the last term, what would you have done differently? For those who served the last term, what would you have done differently? \nAs I have been on Council now for 8 years there are things that I see that Council needs to do differently. While I voted against demolishing the Kangaroo Flat Leisure Centre I did not succeed in getting an alternative plan in place. The Council has voted consistently to employ additional staff each year, this year 18 new positions. I believe that redeployment of staff is more sustainable. As Council changes its priorities staff could move around the organisation. While I agree with the new organics collection I voted against the process of how it was introduced and employing a private contractor at a cost of about $7m over 7 years is not good financial management. \nCommunication and consultation can always be improved and with a budget of over $200m Council can and needs to do it a lot better. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nI am not a member of or aligned with a political party. \nGordon Moore \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nI am standing as a candidate to represent the ratepayers of Bendigo. I have no business affiliations or investments and no land to develop. I am running solely on the position of open and fair representation. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nI have a wide range of experiences and skills I believe will assist in the role of councillor. I have worked for small and large businesses, run my own small business and have extensive customer service/facilitation skills. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nA councillor should be honest and reliable, they should listen to the needs of the community.I believe the most important thing a councillor can be is available. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \nInfrastructure : Basic infrastructure, footpath construction and maintenance, guttering. These are all required so people can easily access public transport. \nGreen space: Public parks and garden upgrades and maintenance. these are basic requirements for a healthy community. \nRepresentation: to make sure the community is heard, not ignored. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nSustainable infrastructure upgrades for future proofing Bendigo \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nAgeing infrastructure and the cost of upgrading existing services to accommodate the expected population growth of Bendigo over the next twenty years. \nMichelle Goldsmith \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nBecause I am an Eaglehawk local, having lived all my life in Bendigo and Eaglehawk, including raising my three children here. I care about progressive, open, collaborative and transparent local government. I value highly Bendigo’s unique status as the city within a forest, and I believe a healthy environment means a healthy community. I am committed to using my experience and knowledge to make the bold decisions which will have long-term positive impacts, within a changing climate, for the people of Bendigo, rather than for regressive, populist, divisive or short-sighted vested interests. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nI am a registered nurse at St John of God hospital critical care unit. I am also a registered mental-health nurse. I have worked in Bendigo as program co-ordinator and facilitator in relationship education and communication. My vision is of a progressive society which values fairness, respect, equity and the environment. I care about a consultative process and approach to local government – council is THE most accountable level of government – which ensures sustainable planning and development. My career as a nurse brings me into close contact with people from all walks of life, who are also my fellow community members, and I feel I have a demonstrated ability to listen to and understand a broad range of views and concerns regarding the diverse issues, urban and rural, which they express. As a first-time candidate, I am very willing to add my talents to the skills and knowledge of Councillors Peter Cox and James Williams and can see the three of us working well together to represent Whipstick Ward. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nAn ability to work in a patient, respectful and open-minded manner with people of all kinds. \nDedication to the role of councillor in seeking to be informed and well-read in all matters of local governance and issues before council. \nAn ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance whilst juggling the various demands of public life / professional work / family. \nPossession of a forward-looking, inclusive and open world-view which ensures an ability to see the bigger picture in terms of where Bendigo may progress in the future. \nLocal knowledge and long-term connection and commitment to their ward community and the City of Greater Bendigo as a whole. \nThe ability and willingness to learn and evolve into the role of councillor. \nWhat are your top three priorities for your ward and why? \nSecure home-based services to the elderly, people living with disability, children and young families. \nOngoing investment for public infrastructure, open spaces and service and sports groups. \nAdvancing the Draft Eaglehawk Station Precinct Master Plan which supports the Bendigo Integrated Transport and Land Use Strategy and the Eaglehawk Structure Plan. \nThese are the broad issues which directly impact the quality of life and communal amenity of people of Whipstick Ward. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nI am passionate about encouraging, celebrating and supporting social diversity and inclusiveness in Bendigo. \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nWelcoming and integrating increasing numbers of people of multi-ethnic, multi-faith backgrounds harmoniously into the Bendigo community. \nDealing with the significant impacts of a changing climate. \nArresting the growing gap between socio-economic advantage and disadvantage in Bendigo. \nEnsuring Bendigo is at the forefront of 21st century industry and innovation in terms of renewables and sustainability. \nMaintenance of Bendigo’s vibrant arts and culture precinct. \nDealing with Bendigo’s toxic legacy from our gold-mining past. \nProtecting Bendigo’s urban boundaries and unique biodiversity to ensure complete “liveability” of our city. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nI am a member of the Australian Greens, past co-convenor of the Bendigo Greens, and a formally endorsed Greens candidate. \nAndrea Metcalfe \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nMy experience with and observations of Council is that the Councillors do not always have all of the necessary information required to make well informed, balanced decisions. Recommendations appear steered in certain directions. \nI have the time to research issues and am willing to pay for independent research when required so that I can make fair and balanced decisions. Residents must have confidence that when decisions are made, all relevant information is available and considered. \nThere is a real opportunity to involve our community in some decision making. Not token consultation, but residents having direct access to the Councillors and Executive team in regular forums, so the people making the decisions hear the concerns and suggestions put forward by residents. \nSometimes decisions are made that not all residents agree with. At these times the communication lines must be open. I support direct question time being reintroduced at Council meetings. \nOur rural areas need to be directly canvassed as to their most important priority to ensure that rural areas needs are addressed. Our rural areas are telling me they feel they are neglected. \nI am standing because if I want things to change I have to be part of the change. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nI am an independent candidate and have a track record of being able to successfully stand up to Council when required. It isn’t easy when you feel like you are swimming against the tide of opinion. Residents need to know there is a strong voice acting in the community’s interests on Council. I will be out and about in the community including our rural areas on a regular basis and invite people to talk to me in informal settings about what their issues are. \nI come to this election with no hidden agendas and am willing to listen to all parties before making decisions. \nAfter four years of interacting with and directly observing Council procedures, I feel I have obtained a good grounding to undertake the role of a Councillor. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nResilience, hard work, honesty and integrity, good research skills, the time to do the job properly, a good listener and being accessible to the community. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \nManagement of our creek system, in particular Bendigo Creek. The Bendigo Creek levee system requires repair and the Bendigo Council has made no commitment towards the cost of upgrading it. As an unmanaged system, it can’t be assumed that the infrastructure will provide flood protection. I am actively involved as a community representative on flood mitigation suggestions to Council in the Epsom/Huntly area \nWe need to be actively working with our rural communities to support them. I put forward a budget suggestion this year that farmers get a bigger reduction in their rates, in line with what other Councils offer their rural communities. In talking with residents of rural areas, the overwhelming feeling is that they contribute more in rates than they get back in return. I want rural communities to decide priorities for their areas, so that these can be included in the next Council four year plan and budget. \nThere are greater efficiencies to be made within Council which would benefit all wards. These efficiencies could then be used on core services. I want to see real rate capping for residents as continual increases directly impact residents on fixed incomes. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nWaste management. It’s time to have an open and honest discussion with residents in Bendigo about what they can do to help reduce waste. Initiatives like a hard waste collection service could be discussed. Would this reduce the dumping of rubbish in our bushland? Could charities reduce their costs if they weren’t having to pay waste charges for rubbish dumped at their doorstep? \nHow can we as a community live more sustainably and reduce our waste? For those people producing little waste, can 90 litre garbage, recycle and organic bins be made available with the charges for these directly matching the size of the bin? \nLet’s invite residents to come forward with their ideas on what can be done to save money for Council. There were three submissions to the Citizens Jury on managing waste, so people are already thinking about this issue. \nLonger term what can be done with our waste. Can we convert our waste to energy? Can we build something here within Bendigo rather than transporting our waste to other areas? \nThere are no simple fixes, but we have to start the conversation in a way that encourages people to have their say. \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nWe need to look at what efficiencies this Council can make, so that the impact of rate capping has a minimal impact on the services council provides to the community. This will lead to discussions and decisions about what Bendigo Council should be spending its rate money on. Always there are competing priorities. Services may need to be rationalised if there are other sectors that can deliver the same service, but before anything is decided we need the community to provide their feedback on the issue. Sometimes it isn’t always about dollars. Additionally, the issue of cost shifting from other levels of Government to Council will be an issue that needs to be addressed. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nI am not aligned to a political party and am standing as an independent candidate. \nMalcolm Pethybridge \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nI have lived and worked in Bendigo, over 40 years. I would like to promote Industry and Business to come to Bendigo and to help preserve the business we have along with our jobs. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \n40 years of knowledge in mechanical engineering, gold mining, house and factory building, farming, and working with contractors. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? \nUnderstanding, listening, and common sense, while listening to rate payers, businesses of all types, including our farmers. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \nRoads sealed, in the urban areas of the Whipstick Ward for safety on our roads. \nFootpaths around schools and around suburbs this is for safety for our children and for our elderly to accommodate mobile shooters and walkers. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nIndustry, business and jobs, let’s get Bendigo working. \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nHarmony, truth and common-sense between the council, councillors, and all the people of the Greater Bendigo. \nIf you were a councillor during the last term, what would you have done differently? For those who served the last term, what would you have done differently? \nNo. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nNo. \nJulie Hoskin \nWhy are you standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election? \nI am standing as a candidate in the City of Greater Bendigo council election because I think drastic change is needed regarding the operations of Council and the City of Greater Bendigo business arenas and I believe I can contribute to making a change for the better. \nWhat can you offer as a candidate? \nAs a former employee of the COGB, I worked in the Building and Planning Department and other areas of council. I have invaluable training and experience that gives me understanding of, not only the broader protocols and procedures of council, but also the interdepartmental procedures and protocols. This provides an enormous advantage when it comes to dealing with specific council departments. \nI’m a fourth generation Bendigonian and have lived and worked in Bendigo all my life, operated my own business, raised my family and managed properties here, which has given me a broad understanding of the needs and concerns of residents and businesses. \nRegular attendance to council and ward meetings has kept me abreast of issues. I have strongly advocated for residents over matters relating to council decisions, including VCAT and the courts. \nI have hosted many international guests of various ethnic and religious backgrounds in my home for extended periods. \nI have the skill-set to equip me to deal with most areas of council and its employees, to relate to and advocate strongly for residents of all persuasions and to work cohesively with other councillors for the benefit of our region. \nWhat qualities do you believe are important for a councillor? They need to consult and bring the people with them in their decision making, ensure that residents can access clear, complete information from council so they can make informed decisions about matters that impact them and together act to resolve concerns in a timely manner. To be pro active in seeking new ideas, funding and incentives to facilitate job creation, education, health and wealth building for the region. It is important for councillors to develop a good relationship with the business community (city and rural) to ensure that wealth and job growth are fostered. They need to be proficient in liaising and negotiating with executives and staff at the City of Greater Bendigo business offices and to work maturely and cohesively together to facilitate and expedite good outcomes for the community and for the future development of the region. To quickly develop a good grasp of the financial/economic and strategic planning positions and agendas of the COGB in order to manage issues surrounding those critical aspects of council business. It’s important that councillors recognize the importance of their unique as representatives of residents and understand that the COGB CEO and executives are accountable to them, not the other way around. They must maintain a high level of integrity and accountability and adhere to the Councillor Code of Conduct and the Local Government Act. \nWhat are your three top priorities for your ward, and why? \nConsultation with residents and businesses across the ward needs to happen before councillors move to implement plans. Due to the dissatisfaction levels toward council, a problem that is consistently raised in the numerous council reviews, it’s imperative that a fresh start is facilitated to bring residents alongside councillors in their decision making and to restore confidence. Business and Job creation: Bendigo has great schools and universities producing high quality students who are job ready but we have a lack of suitable employment opportunities to keep those skills in the Bendigo region. Whipstick ward has possibly the highest level of unemployment and requires a wide variety of employment options and solutions to accommodate and encourage participation of long and short term unemployed residents of varying degrees of education and qualification. Encouraging and facilitating new and existing businesses to expand/broaden their horizons in order to take on more employees from the Bendigo region is a priority. Infrastructure and maintenance issues need to be addressed where there has been long term neglect of council responsibility, particularly in rural areas. Address issues of waste and mismanagement within council and reinstate those funds to areas of primary need such as community care programs. \nWhat issue in our community are you most passionate about? \nSocial justice under an honest, uncompromised and transparent council. A fair go and equal opportunities for all Bendigo residents to be consulted and to have their concerns properly and honestly addressed by the relevant authorities, to obtain meaningful employment, decent services and infrastructure, health services, housing and opportunities to advance themselves in business and education (for future job growth) and to live in a quality environment. To achieve this, councillors must perform at a high level to address the financial, planning and core operational arenas of the City of Greater Bendigo business as well as functioning in their duty to act as representatives of the people. \nWhat are the biggest challenges facing greater Bendigo? \nRebuilding confidence and trust in the community. Financial limitations and restrictions due to present and past waste and mismanagement by council. Lack of infrastructure and jobs to cater for the growing population. \nIf you were a councillor during the last term, what would you have done differently? For those who served the last term, what would you have done differently? \nMaintain the vital, separate role of the function of Councillors from the CEO and executives instead of allowing them to dictate agendas. \nUpheld my duty as a councillor to be transparent in decision making-ensure that residents were brought alongside, given the right to challenge areas of council decision making and offered meaningful resolution to issues that impact them. \nKept the CEO and executives accountable to produce clear, accurate and current information in a timely manner. \nEnsure that senior management and staff held relevant qualifications for their positions to ensure that residents enjoy best outcomes from their council and call for the resignation of those who consistently fail to produce satisfactory outcomes under their respective portfolios. \nChange the Mayoral rotation system and involve the public in such decision making. \nEnd abuse and waste of public monies and unjust litigation through VCAT. Eg: Mosque permit, Hopley Demolitions and Kangaroo Flat Community Centre. \nEnsured that councillor’s pecuniary and business declaration interests were accurate-avoid conflict of interests. Stop councillors from voting in a bloc to force through agendas contrary to the will of residents. Stop the falsification of records of ward meetings that skews historical accounts of meetings. \nAre you, or have you ever been, aligned with a political party? If so, which? \nI am independent.

Excruciating pressure. This was the feeling felt by all Somerset fans as they watched Day Four of Middlesex versus Yorkshire, knowing a draw would be required for the Cidermen to at last lay their hands on that trophy, and lift it up high. It's never happened in 141 years, yet there was the fundamental feeling – is it safe to say that this was to be our year? In the morning, it seemed as though it may be. Middlesex were stuck batting and weren't advancing sufficiently quick. However, taking after an examination between the two chiefs, an aggregate was conceded to, and Middlesex went ahead to win. \n\nAs Toby Roland-Jones released Ryan Sidebottom to get his cap trap, 10 wickets in the match, and secure his side the County Championship, I ran numb with stun. Have we truly passed up a major opportunity once more? At the end of the day Runners Up? Continuously the bridesmaid, never the lady. However this inclination died down, and what rose up out of that was a sentiment pride. I felt pride at what the side had accomplished. Tipped for assignment by a few, we demonstrated them wrong and given our everything to win the area title. What's more, with a youthful squad, what's to come is definitely looking splendid. \n\nI review the grumblings felt by Somerset fans after late years of transfer scraps – there's too much \"imports\" in the group, insufficient home developed representation, and I concurred with them. Presently however, we have a side loaded with ability from the foundation – something to lock on to, be glad for. In Marcus Trescothick and Tom Abell, we have a crash of the old and the new. One, a veteran whose support of his province and openness with his psychological well-being fights has made him a standout amongst the most regarded players as of now in the diversion, and perhaps ever. In Tom Abell we have a youthful prospect, who's enhancing constantly, and has demonstrated the qualities required to be a fruitful opener, while likewise exemplifying what's great about this youthful product of players – he's affable, gets on well with the backing, and will give his just for the group. \n\nAt four, we have one of the best ever batsman in English Cricket history never to get a ring – James Hildreth. His century against Notts, on one leg, tottering around the wrinkle, not able to move his feet, yet holding on because of his yearning to help the group, will go down in fables. It was second on Cricinfo's snapshots of the district title season[1], where it was depicted by David Hopps as \"a standout amongst the most rebellious Championship hundreds of years ever.\" Another exemplifying snapshot of the battle demonstrate this season, this by a man as of now a Somerset legend – and he's lone 32. \n\nDespite the fact that he's 35, it appears this was the season Pete Trego developed with the bat. Coming in at 6, with a conflicting tail behind him, he comprehended the centrality of his part in the batting line up, and played it to flawlessness. More than 1000 County Championship keeps running surprisingly, a century against Lancashire that beat his past most noteworthy top notch score, and a status and development appeared on the pitch that has made him a ton of supporter's selection for skipper next season. \n\nThe knocking down some pins division was the place there was the most measure of movement for the home developed ability: Craig Overton and Lewis Gregory's insights may propose they were underneath on a year ago's execution levels (in light of wickets taken), yet this year has seen their overall diversion create. They have needed to deal with pitches that haven't suited their style (particularly at home), and the harm to Jamie Overton, who was having a profoundly amazing season before damage, implied they were required to have much a greater amount of the assault and play all the more regularly, than anticipated. Furthermore, they have gotten through the season demonstrating the improvement all fans need to see – particularly Craig, whose lady FC century may have been more suited to the shorter configurations, yet gives consolation as it shows he is following up on his capability to be a rocking the bowling alley all-rounder. \nturn twinsNow, it's a great opportunity to acclaim two of the most far-fetched of Somerset hotshots: the previous Sainsbury's trolley kid, and a 19 year old from Sidmouth. On the other hand Jack Leach and Dom Bess. For the previous, this season has been incredible, having taken 65 CC wickets to complete second in the Division One wicket taking stakes. He demonstrated he could manage the weight of taking the wickets at home on a turning deck, and far from home could take wickets and give backing to the seamers in equivalent measure. In spite of the fact that it was disillusioning he didn't get chose to go to Bangladesh, he is a genuine ability, and somebody will's identity vital in forming the club's future. Particularly in the event that he proceeds with his last wicket heroics! Also, in the event that he does turn into England's main? All things considered, Dom Bess isn't resembling a terrible substitution either – 13 wickets in his initial two CC amusements at 10.46 isn't an awful approach to begin your vocation! I have not figured out how to see him dish, but rather from what I have listened, and from watching him in post-play interviews, he is by all accounts a quiet, sensible individual, and one who I'm certain the club will hope to support. \n\nThat tirade demonstrates how essential the home developed ability is – yet it would be totally wrong of me to overlook the commitments of others. Jim Allenby has gone under much feedback in his time at Somerset, particularly in the wake of calling one supporter a \"handle\" on twitter, yet from my short communications with him, he strikes me as a better than average bloke who just blew his wire after a touch of stick. His commitments this season however with both bat and ball have been imperative – five 50s have ceased early falls, and his 21 wickets @ 28, going at 2.45 an over, has brought control and experience (alongside Tim Groenewald) to our unpracticed knocking down some pins line up. \n\nTimmy G completed second in our CC wicket taking rundown (with 37), and his experience was pivotal to the side as said some time recently. Commander Chris Rogers, in the meeting I directed with him, depicted him as \" fabulous\", including \"he leads from the front… he's nearly dragged a couple of alternate folks with him, and I see him conversing with alternate bowlers, letting them know what he supposes should be done, and that is incredible to have.\" Johann Myburgh may have just played in three CC diversions, yet his century and two fifties help him best the midpoints diagram, furthermore helped Somerset beat Notts at Trent Bridge. \n\nDutch all-rounder Roelof van der Merwe had a poor begin to the season, yet when he came back to the side, turning into Leach's accomplice in twist, he turned into a critical figure in the side, with his handling, knocking down some pins (22 wickets at 27.9) and once in a while his batting – his 102* close by Craig Overton broke the eighth wicket organization beforehand held by a specific IVA Richards and IT Botham. This was later surpassed by Trego and Ryan Davies. The youthful wicket guardian had a blended begin to the season, with his continuing inspiring and his batting less so. In any case, he finished the season well, making his most elevated FC score of 86 against Lancashire, and another 50 in the last amusement against Notts. \n\nChris \"Buck\" Rogers. Much thanks to you. That is the thing that I offer you taking after the declaration of your retirement. Much thanks to you such a great amount for helping this club create – the impact you have had on the squad is self-evident, and the enduring legacy I think your short residency as chief will have ought to be huge. This squad has got so much potential, however your captaincy has formed it in the correct path, by demonstrating how essential the will to battle is, and it's vastly improved to chance losing going for the win as opposed to simply play alright for the draw. When I talked with you, I got some information about the notorious Australian players who included for Somerset – I trust that in your single season at the club, you may have added your name to that rundown, as the club's fortunes seem to have been changed totally, from assignment contender to title-challengers. \n\nAt long last, I might want to offer recognition to Matt Maynard. I have publically apologized to him on twitter having called for him to go taking after another unfortunate t20 amusement, however this current season's County Championship structure has seen Maynard, as I would see it, demonstrate why he is profoundly appraised in the diversion, and he has shown himself as ready to address insufficiencies when they happen, for example, a gigantic change in handling from a poor begin to the season. \n\nIn spite of the fact that we didn't get the title needed, I truly delighted in the past season.

To add to his problems, Topper misses his dad, who is off sailing the seven seas or who knows - perhaps even further away than that. But one day, Topper finds something amazing, and suddenly life isn't quite so boring after all. He finds a pencil - not an ordinary pencil, mind - that wouldn't be special at all. No, this one can do magic! Together with his best friend, Viggo, Topper is about to discover all the incredible things this kind of pencil can be used for. Topper and Viggo live in the same old, red brick building. The ground floor is occupied by the Red Catfish Café owned by Viggo's dad, Mr Lion. Topper lives on the second floor - and it is here that he and Viggo draw a rhino on the wall - a yellow rhino with three horns. They don't have to wait long for something magical to happen. Moments later the rhino comes alive!

Both are accused of raping her on one occasion, before arguing over who should have taken her virginity. \nMiss Teen USA 2013 Cassidy Wolf interviews Donald Trump. Ms Wolf is not the claimant. Source: Jonathan Bachman/PA \nViolent \n“I travelled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a modelling career,” the claimant said in a statement. \n“I went to several modelling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a modelling portfolio before I would be considered. \n“I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to start to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. \n“She told me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to people who could get me into the modelling profession,” she added. Tiffany also told me I would be paid for attending. The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. \n“Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr Epstein, including Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr Trump and Mr Epstein knew I was 13 years old. Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. \nTrump in 2006, at Fenway Park in Boston. Source: AP/Press Association Images \nPolitically motivated \n“On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. \n“Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.” \nDonald Trump denies all charges of sexual abuse being levelled against him. \nAlan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for the Trump Organization, told Snopes that the allegations “are completely frivolous and appear to be politically motivated”. \nIn May, the claimant’s attorney Tom Meagher told The Daily Beast that of course the case was politically motivated. \n“Of course, she does not want her rapist to be president,” Meagher said.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"donald trump","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"tom meagher","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jonathan bachman/pa  violent","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jonathan","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"trump","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"snopes","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"alan garten","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jeffrey epstein","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"meagher","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"wolf","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tiffany","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cassidy wolf","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"epstein","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"trump organization","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"trump","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ap/press association images  politically","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"comments trump","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"new york","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"new york city","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"fenway park","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"us","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"port authority","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"boston","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"upper east side","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:56:03.600+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"1643898d0c375dacf693f8142e393a560019a1bd","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg_TjCqUE4HFcm9pLSM7KUSmu1yScYtTR3cO31ahxminSE68aAPe7ZYZksDAYPNg_ow6kxPQ1t94HkG.o493HqwuRUNXXgmTWvQhI3_TCPS3EcUNqKDHk53w","site_full":"www.celebuzz.com","site":"celebuzz.com","site_section":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/celebuzz/fOdf","site_categories":["entertainment"],"section_title":"Celebuzz","title":"So Spoiled: ‘Walking Dead’ Creator Says the Show Won’t Have the Comic Book’s Ending","title_full":"So Spoiled: ‘Walking Dead’ Creator Says the Show Won’t Have the Comic Book’s Ending","published":"2016-10-04T16:56:09.957+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":1,"site_type":"news","country":"US","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2016/10/walking-dead-oct3-lead-1475541533-compressed.jpg","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":10303,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"1643898d0c375dacf693f8142e393a560019a1bd","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg_TjCqUE4HFcm9pLSM7KUSmu1yScYtTR3cO31ahxminSE68aAPe7ZYZksDAYPNg_ow6kxPQ1t94HkG.o493HqwuRUNXXgmTWvQhI3_TCPS3EcUNqKDHk53w","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"Scott Baumgartner","published":"2016-10-04T16:56:09.957+03:00","title":"So Spoiled: ‘Walking Dead’ Creator Says the Show Won’t Have the Comic Book’s Ending","text":"MORE >> \nAre you a superfan desperate for the latest news on your favorite show?

Robert Kirkman , the creator of both, revealed that he’d like the book to outlast the AMC show by a long shot. \n“I know how I want to end The Walking Dead , the book. But I can’t tell anyone, because I don’t want it on the show before I get it in the comic.

The situation in besieged, rebel-held eastern Aleppo demanded bold new initiatives \"including proposals to limit the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council\", said High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein. That would enable major powers to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court, a step previously blocked by Russia and China. \"Such a referral would be more than justified given the rampant and deeply shocking impunity that has characterised the conflict and the magnitude of the crimes that have been committed, some of which may indeed amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" Zeid said in a statement. Syria's government and its allies had undertaken a \"pattern of attacks\" against targets protected by international law, including medical units, aid workers and water-pumping stations, he said. There was no immediate reaction from Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that the Russian air force would continue to support Syrian government troops and that what he called the \"war on terror\" would continue. Zeid, a former Security Council president, was not advocating abolishing the veto, but lifting it for very serious cases of international crimes, his spokesman Rupert Colville said. \"Look at Aleppo, look what's happening. I think you will never have a more compelling case for something serious, action to be taken,\" Colville told a U.N. briefing. Russia is highly unlikely to accept any constraint on its U.N. veto power, which together with its military involvement on the side of President Bashar al-Assad has given it formidable leverage in the Syria crisis, frustrating the United States. BANNED BY TREATY Zeid said that dropping indiscriminate incendiary weapons in heavily populated areas was particularly concerning, as well as being banned by a treaty that Russia is bound by. He compared Aleppo to the World War Two battles of Warsaw, Stalingrad and Dresden, and said calling the enemy a \"terrorist organisation\" was not an excuse to ignore the laws of war. The rebels' use of inaccurate \"hell-fire cannons\", homemade mortars that fire gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel, was also totally unacceptable, he said. World Health Organization spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said that between Sept. 23 and Oct. 2, 342 people had been killed in eastern Aleppo, including 106 children, and 1,129 had been wounded, including 261 children. Those figures were based on reports from functioning health centres and the true figures were probably much higher, she said. \"As of yesterday, we have now only six partially functional hospitals that are in service, only one hospital that offers trauma care services,\" Chaib told the briefing. WHO still hopes to be able to evacuate dozens of wounded and chronically ill from Aleppo, she said. \"We are preparing plans, we are in contact with several hospitals inside and outside the country, but unless there is security and access we cannot move.\" The Syrian government has yet to respond to a U.N. plan for aid convoys in Syria during the month of October, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke said, noting that the last \"cross line\" convoy was on Sept. 25.

They said they inflicted losses on pro-government fighters after several hours of clashes on the fringe of Sheikh Saed district, at the southern edge of the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo city. \"We repelled their attempt to advance in Sheikh Saed and killed 10 regime fighters and destroyed several vehicles,\" said a fighter from the Failaq al-Sham rebel group who gave his name as Abdullah al-Halabi. Pro-government media said the Syrian army was pressing ahead in a major campaign supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power to take full control of the divided northern Syrian city after a ceasefire collapsed last month. The army offensive is backed by an air campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's government and its allies that has hit hospitals, destroyed infrastructure and caused hundreds of civilian casualties. In the 15 days since the collapse of the ceasefire, war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented the deaths of 293 civilians in besieged east Aleppo as a result of air strikes and shelling. It documented 25 deaths in government-held west Aleppo as a result of rebel shelling. Another rebel commander from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki group said the army had opened several fronts simultaneously since the launch of a ground assault in order to stretch rebel forces, and had dropped leaflets from helicopters calling on them to surrender. After securing the strategic Handarat camp in the northern edge of the city last Thursday following what rebels described as carpet bombing, the army pressed on south of the camp. It took the ruins of the former Kindi hospital, from where soldiers could control the Jandoul traffic circle, a major road intersection. \"They levelled the ground and our people had no choice but to retreat under the bombing of the Russians,\" the Zinki commander said. Rebels say Kurdish YPG militia controlling the strategic Sheikh Maqsoud district in north Aleppo city have also taken advantage of the army gains to move towards the Shuqif industrial area that lies between Handarat and their enclave. That would allow the army and its allied militias to move deeper into rebel-held northern districts of the city, although rebels expect the army thrust will slow in residential areas that offer them more cover from air raids. \"The battles inside the city's districts as the regime applies more pressure will be difficult as these areas are better defended and will allow the rebels to hold out,\" said Halabi. In the heart of the city, war planes believed to be Russian and flying at high altitude hit Bustan al Qasr, Hay al Huluk and Fardous neighbourhoods with reports of casualties, several rebel contacts said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had documented 20 deaths from shelling and air strikes on rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Tuesday. State television said insurgent shelling killed five people in government-held areas of the city on Tuesday. State media said rebel-shelling into a university complex in government-held Aleppo had killed one and injured eight. In the Aleppo countryside, Russian and Syrian war planes dropped incendiary bombs on the towns of Darat Izza and al-Zirba. RUSSIAN EMBASSY HIT The Russian embassy in Damascus was hit by mortar fire on Monday, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. According to the statement, two mortar shells exploded near the embassy and another hit the area close to an apartment block on the mission's territory. \"It was by chance that none of the embassy employees were injured,\" the statement said. The Russian foreign ministry said the shells had been fired from the Jobar neighbourhood east of Damascus. Jobar is controlled by rebel groups Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and Failaq al-Rahman and mortars fired from there occasionally reach central Damascus. This is not the first time this year shells have fallen around the embassy. \"We see the shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria as the result of actions of those, who like the U.S. and some of their allies, provoke the continuation of the bloody conflict in Syria by flirting with militants and various kinds of extremists,\" the Russian ministry added. Separately, rebels fighting Islamic State militants said they killed at least 30 militants after a failed attempt to gain ground in Eastern Qalamoun area, north of Damascus, where fighting has escalated in recent weeks.

Donald Duck had Trombone Trouble in 1944, Music Hall comic Jimmy Edwards spoofed in 1966 before the Jack Parnell Orchestra, and of course there was Douglas in a certain Danish butter advert. But listen again, as the trombone has an unsurpassed grace and elegance in jazz. Tommy Dorsey’s plaintive and muted control on ‘Song of India’, Curtis Fuller’s drive on Art Blakey’s ‘Caravan’, or Robin Eubanks’ defining presence in the Dave Holland Quintet, to give a few examples. \nOne of the finest British jazz trombonists of his generation is Mark Nightingale, who returns in October with the Andy Panayi Quartet at Dereham Jazz. This monthly Norfolk session is now firmly re-ensconced at the town’s golf club. \nMark Nightingale came through the youth jazz orchestra route in the early 1980s, starting with Midland YJO and progressing to the national NYJO (who you can see in their present line-up at Saffron Hall this month). Nightingale has since contributed to the BBC Big Band, and maintained his own eponymous large ensemble, while also leading a funk-oriented Quintet (Out of the Box LP) that both features the mercurial alto saxophonist Nigel Hitchcock and pays a nod to Eubanks’ M-Base origins. As it happens, Mark Nightingale was hosted last month at the occasional music and dinner invitations at Tithe Barn in Needham, near Harleston (see the Music 2016 page at gilllevin.wordpress.com ). \nTrombonists are however becoming a rare breed; and the trombone is not an instrument you can just pick up later in life for a bit of busking. Compared with playing the saxophone (or trumpet, for that matter) school pupils are half as likely to be taking up the trombone – according to a national survey in 2005 (going back a bit I know) – in spite of most local school services offering lessons in the instrument. There is also a gender issue here: as with guitar and drums in the jazz line-up, trombone has a presumed blokeishness. \nThankfully therefore we also have in Annie Whitehead an inspiration not just across British jazz and large-ensemble projects but also through her earlier pop, folk and African ‘new wave’ musical connections. A Lancastrian, Whitehead also came through an YJO (Manchester’s) but brought to her sound past experience in brass bands and a 1940s-style institution by the name of the Ivy Benson All Girl Orchestra. \nAmong the current generation of modern jazz trombone leaders is Cambridge-born Tom Green, who studied under Mark Nightingale. He’ll be back for the Cambridge Jazz Festival in November but let’s hope he and other exponents of the less-favoured ‘bone will be showcased at some of our venues soon.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"roger morfey","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"curtis fuller","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"nigel hitchcock","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jimmy edwards","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"andy panayi quartet","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"mark nightingale","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dave holland quintet","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"robin eubanks","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"annie whitehead","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom green","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"donald duck","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"eubanks","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"douglas","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"art blakey","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"whitehead","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tommy dorsey","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"grapevine magazine","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bbc","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"midland yjo","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jack parnell orchestra","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"manchester","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"tithe barn","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"needham","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"norfolk","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dereham jazz","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"harleston","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"saffron hall","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"india","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:56:37.372+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"1cb42a802c43e028a279e972abb8396198f8894d","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.F_PTg4uy5TMt4CEnv3UO8QxySunzEuq2b5JyXJio_kmJoaFKE6XSwf5am3nYqW43fUM4WiOpme7bkgAfERvy3AoDPQPjIy0.VXNVx4XfUrdPPPbi_s7Mh4h8GnA7QhJf.TiP9C88fow--","site_full":"www.informazione.it","site":"informazione.it","site_section":"http://www.informazione.it/xml/pr/rssfeed.xml?lng=en-us","site_categories":["news","blogs","education"],"section_title":"I Comunicati Stampa su informazione.it (EN)","title":"MGT Industries Adopts Centric Software","title_full":"MGT Industries Adopts Centric Software","published":"2016-10-04T16:56:39.532+03:00","replies_count":0,"participants_count":0,"site_type":"blogs","country":"IT","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"http://i8.informazione.it/pruploads/c7da63e7-641f-42da-9790-f112258b4071/Jonquil%20Gown%20Crop[2].jpg","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":72811,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"1cb42a802c43e028a279e972abb8396198f8894d","url":"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg.F_PTg4uy5TMt4CEnv3UO8QxySunzEuq2b5JyXJio_kmJoaFKE6XSwf5am3nYqW43fUM4WiOpme7bkgAfERvy3AoDPQPjIy0.VXNVx4XfUrdPPPbi_s7Mh4h8GnA7QhJf.TiP9C88fow--","ord_in_thread":0,"author":"","published":"2016-10-04T16:56:39.532+03:00","title":"MGT Industries Adopts Centric Software","text":"MGT Industries Adopts Centric Software The American sleepwear company chooses Centric PLM to wake up product development. CAMPBELL, 04/10/2016 - 15:45 ( informazione.it - comunicati stampa - information technology ) MGT Industries, the American sleepwear company has selected Centric Software to provide its PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) solution. Centric is the leading product lifestyle management (PLM) solution for fashion, retail, footwear, luxury, outdoor and consumer goods companies. MGT Industries, based in Los Angeles, was founded 30 years ago. They design and produce sleepwear for private labels and for their own brands – In Bloom, Jonquil, and Linea Donatella. Business is expanding so MGT Industries decided to seek a new PLM system. “We had an internal tech pack system that worked for us for many years, but as our business started to evolve, production increased and we began working with more factories overseas. We needed to be nimble and more efficient in the way we create and develop product,” explains Tom Stevenson, Vice President of Operations. The company went through a rigorous evaluation process of the different PLM systems available on the market and their user team unanimously voted for Centric Software. “The first key differentiator was Centric’s reputation. The second asset was that they are totally focused on PLM. They do it very well and they don’t have any internally competing projects. The last thing we liked was their approach to product; they keep making their solutions better and better with a regular flow of new innovations,” continues Stevenson. MGT Industries will use Centric’s full PLM suite including mobile apps and Adobe Illustrator integration. “Centric will help us streamline our business processes and free up our designers and technical teams so they have more time for creativity and innovation. We are all looking forward to minimizing administrative tasks,” explains Jill Mazur, Project Manager. “The ability to work directly in Adobe and to mark changes up without having to leave the program and go and update them in another application is also something that we found very exciting. We’ll be rolling out Centric to merchandisers and designers first. These mentors will then be able to support their fellow users to get up and running,” continues Stevenson, “We intend to make the most of Centric.” “We are not only looking forward to our implementation but we are also very excited about the fact that Centric continues to grow and develop their solutions. They provide new tools and listen to their customer’s feedback so that as we are growing, we may have the opportunity to implement features we hadn’t thought in the past,” Jill concludes. “We are very happy to have been selected by MGT Industries and we look forward to partnering with them as their business grows,” says Chris Groves, President and CEO of Centric.“ MGT Industries (www.inbloomintimates.com) MGT Industries is a Los Angeles based sleepwear manufacturer specializing in private label programs as well as designing and producing their own in house brands, In Bloom, Jonquil, and Linea Donatella.

As they split, Katie Holmes allegedly agreed to refrain from seeing someone publicly until 2017 in order to keep from embarrassing her ex-husband. Holmes was also restricted from allowing any of the men she may be seeing to spend time with her daughter, 10-year-old Suri Cruise.\nKatie Holmes And Jamie Foxx Are Facing Wedding Rumors, Reports Of A Tom Cruise Feud https://t.co/Alz4uol58q \n— Inquisitr News (@theinquisitr) October 2, 2016 \nWhile the terms of her divorce appear to be quite strict, Katie Holmes reportedly agreed to the terms because she so badly wanted to end her marriage to Cruise. In addition, Katie Holmes was given $5 million for agreeing to abide by the rules.\nAlthough Katie Homes and Jamie Foxx have never confirmed their rumored romance, the pair has been seen together regularly since they were first linked to one another in 2013. Most recently, Katie Holmes was seen cheering on her rumored boyfriend as he performed on stage with Barbra Streisand at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. According to an Us Weekly report at the time, Katie Holmes was spotted backstage with Foxx during the event.\n“They left from the dressing room area a few minutes apart from each other but she was hanging out in his dressing room with him after the show,” an onlooker told the magazine.\nMonths prior, Katie Holmes joined Foxx in New York City to celebrate his 48th birthday.\n“Jamie is someone [Katie Holmes] can trust and have fun with,” an insider told Us Weekly last year. “She’s getting everything from Jamie that she didn’t get with Tom.”\n“[Katie Holmes] is so in love.

He’s never told me he’s dating her.”\nJordan continued on, claiming that she “misspoke” about Foxx’s possible relationship with Katie Holmes.\n“A lot of times, I get asked questions about celebrities — some I know, some I don’t — and we just give a safe kind of generic answer,” she continued. “Sorry to not have this bombshell story, but I cannot confirm them.”\nKatie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are allegedly planning to get married in November in a super private ceremony after initially postponing a ceremony which was believed to be taking place earlier this year.\n“[Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx] planned to get married earlier this year.

Buy Now Mike Hodgson, Staff \nThe eastern portion of Cachuma Lake, which is underwater in normal years, lies high and dry after the four driest years on record. Downstream water purveyors are hoping for a rainy winter to help refill the reservoir and ultimately recharge downstream aquifers. Buy Now Mike Hodgson, Staff \nThe difference between a full Cachuma Lake and one that's holding at 7 percent of capacity is shown by the high-water marks on the embankments that stand far above the current lake level. \nCommunities that rely on Cachuma Lake to provide some of their potable water are hoping for a wet winter that will raise the reservoir level and allow releases that will recharge groundwater from Santa Ynez to Lompoc. \nWater officials are reluctant to predict how long they can keep taps flowing in their communities if the drought drags on and little precipitation materializes this winter. \nBut if Cachuma remains as low as it is now, very little water will be released downstream to recharge the Santa Ynez River underflow and the Lompoc Valley groundwater basin that provide water to thousands of customers. \n“We try to do long-term strategic planning,” said Matt van der Linden, public works director and city engineer for Solvang. “But it’s kind of hard because the weather is unpredictable.” \nLast year was a classic case in point. Meteorologists said the strongest El Nino condition in years was building up in the Pacific Ocean, and they were joined by emergency planners in warning Central Coast residents to be prepared for heavy storms and flooding. \nBut El Nino flopped, delivering an average of about 70 percent of normal rainfall and making 2012 through 2015 the driest four years on record. \nWhile nature hasn’t delivered on rainfall, the Santa Ynez River Water Conservaton District has had to continue delivering water from Cachuma Lake downstream to meet the water rights of users. \nOver the past four years, the lake level has continued to fall until now it‘s holding 14,177 acre-feet of water, or about 7.3 percent of capacity. \nAn acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or the amount of water generally needed to supply the annual needs of four to 10 people in an urban environment. \n“As the lake has gone down the last four years, with releases and no flow in, the ‘bank account’ got used up,” van der Linden said. \nDownstream water releases were halted about a month ago to preserve the microenvironment and maintain water quality, but water is still lost through evaporation. \n“They’re kind of at the end now,” Tom Fayram, deputy director of water resources for Santa Barbara County, said of the Water Conservation District. “They did what they could. … But until they get flow back in, there won’t be any releases.” \nVan der Linden said that won’t be a problem over the next few months for Solvang, which gets water from three river wells, two upland wells and an allocation of state water. \nIf there is no new water flowing into the lake this winter and no downstream releases, Solvang would have to shut down its river wells, but it has a good supply of state water banked in San Luis Reservoir as a result of buying supplemental water and conserving heavily. \n“But that could have some very serious ramifications for 2018,” Van der Linden said. \nBuellton, which is the next downstream community to rely on river underflow recharge for its wells, is apparently in good shape, drawing water not only from river wells but also an upland well supplemented by state water. \nIn a June water supply report, Rose Hess, the director of public works, said the city has enough water to meet its projected five-year demand even without supplemental state water. \nThe community potentially facing the most problems is Lompoc, which relies totally on groundwater. \n“We’re probably the last step, so except for farmers, we’re pretty much the last stage,” Gene Margheim, the city’s water superintendent, said of the downstream releases from Cachuma Lake. “We got about 2,000 acre-feet, half as much as we were expecting. That’s less than half as much as we use in a year. \n“The basin is rather large, so there’s still water there,” he said. “I don’t claim we have an unlimited supply. If it doesn’t rain, we’ll have to use the remaining groundwater.” \nMargheim won’t speculate on how long Lompoc could hold out if the drought continues and little or no water comes down the Santa Ynez River. \n“It’s hard to make an estimate,” he said. “Theoretically, we could keep drawing down from lower levels (of the groundwater basin). I’m not sure where the bottom is.” \nConservation measures put in place during the 1988-90 drought have been a saving grace for the city, he said. \n“People really squeezed down” on water use, he said. “It’s put us in a position where we’re hoping for rain, but we can get by awhile.” Supervisors to consider water \nThe Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to conduct a hearing Tuesday to consider the reacquisition of the Flood Control and Water Conservation District’s suspended allocation of state water as requested by the Central Coast Water Authority. \nThe board will also conduct a hearing on the status of water supplies in the county and current and planned water supply projects by local purveyors. \nSupervisors will meet at 9 a.m. in the Board Hearing Room on the fourth floor of the County Administration Building, 105 E.

Tigers coach, Tom Watkins is eager to see his team bite back. \nThe Tigers, who beat Manchester Phoenix 4-2 in Telford on Saturday, are still joint top of the early English Premier League standings, alongside Milton Keynes Lightning. \nA dramatic encounter in Peterborough saw the Tigers fight back from an early 2-0 deficit to lead 3-2 with seconds remaining, only for their hosts to equalise on the stroke of full-time. \nAnd after watching his men lose the resulting penalty shoot-out, Watkins criticised their performance in the first two periods. He said: “We definitely didn’t battle enough tonight and we didn’t start battling until the third period. \n“You can’t turn up for just a third of a hockey game without that spirit and it is disappointing with the level of talent we have in the dressing room. \n“I said to the guys that tonight was a big wake-up call for them. That point we’ve lost has got to sting us right now and sting us for the rest of the year.” \nThe first period in Peterborough was an even-handed affair, with neither side able to produce scoring opportunities of any real quality. \nThe second session was more physical and the hosts gave away an early powerplay – although Telford were unable to capitalise. Both Rick Plant and Milan Kolena missed out from close range, but it was Peterborough who opened the scoring on 30 minutes. \nThe Phantoms doubled that advantage just a few minutes later, although Telford again began to regain control towards the end of the period. \nAnd they were rewarded for those efforts with three minutes of the session remaining, when Corey McEwen struck with a fine breakaway effort. \nThe final period saw Telford finally hit their stride with Jason Silverthorn adding a second from close range on 47 minutes. Watkins wants to see the Tigers get back to winning ways. \nJoe Miller then took advantage of another powerplay to give his side the lead for the first time in the game with just nine minutes left. \nBut having removed their netminder in favour of an extra forward, the hosts scored a last-gasp equaliser with three seconds left on the clock. \nThat strike led to overtime and then penalty shots, with Telford seeing two of their shots saved, while Peterborough scored twice to seal victory. \nWatkins added: “Peterborough’s young netminder, Adam Long, was excellent tonight. \n“In many ways, he was the difference. But what happened at the end shouldn’t have happened. \n“We should be able to make sure that with 22 seconds on the clock, we win the face-off, put the puck down the ice and the game is over.

Michael Pascoe comments. \nNarev demonstrated above all the need for a royal commission into his bank's practices. He is being let off the hook far too easily by this government. \nElizabeth Chandler Napoleon Reef \nGrilled? I'd call that lightly toasted. \nKeith Russell Mayfield West Advertisement \nWhen the Australian people got sick of watching the Catholic Church go through the motions of cleaning up its act on child abuse over and over with no real outcomes a royal commission was established (\" Voters reject PM's banking inquiry \", October 4). \nWhen Malcolm Turnbull was horrified by revelations of a different form of child abuse in Northern Territory jails he established a royal commission almost immediately, presumably because he wanted effective action. His failure to do the same to control the damage the banks are inflicting on both individuals and sectors of society indicates that he doesn't want real action – just a whitewash. Ian Narev before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. Photo: Andrew Meares \nRob Bower Peregian Beach \nThe only royal commission we need right now is one inquiring into why the Parliament, both houses, all parties is so dysfunctional. \nDavid Davies Callala Beach \nOf course, we need a strong banking system, Warwick Smith (\" We don't need a bank inquiry \", October 4). But we also need an honest and transparent system, in which its four biggest participants don't rip off customers by refusing to pass on the Reserve Bank's full interest-rate cuts, or by charging excessive interest on credit cards, or by giving incomplete information in financial advice - the list goes on. \nWhat we really need is a royal commission into this \"Gang of Four\". \nRob Phillips North Epping \nSo the chief executives of the big four banks are off to Canberra for a stern grilling by a parliamentary committee. Like being flogged by a warm lettuce as Paul Keating once said of former banker John Hewson. We could have a plebiscite as this appears to be the government's favoured method for dealing with its own deficiencies. Instead, I propose a combined dating/cooking contest - the chief executive who walks off with the rose (maybe Julie Bishop can hand them out) and makes the best chocolate ganache gets to keep his bonuses. \nDavid Farrell Erskineville \nIt appears that the Prime Minister may have severe learning difficulties (\" Turnbull's bank fix has 'compound danger' risk \", October 4). Not only is he unable to \"read the politics\" he is unable to hear the voice of the people on so many issues. Perhaps it's time to call on Dr Phil for an intervention. \nElizabeth Starr Chiswick Less pay the aim \nSo many questions are left unanswered by this productivity commission clanger (\" Welcome to progress on penalty rate reform \", October 4). Why would employers want to lower penalty rates if workers were still going to be better off? How will that make it more economical to employ workers on these if it costs more? No, it's totally transparent that this is a furphy. Employers want the flexibility to pay their workers less. \nAnd why are only retail and hospitality workers targeted by these proposed changes and not doctors and emergency staff? What about those workers that are contracted to only work on weekends - at the new reduced rates - while other employees only work weekdays - how is that fair? \nOur children do not go to school seven days a week, nor do politicians, bank workers or countless others - even productivity commissioners. The fact is that we don't live in a seven day a week economy and nor is it something we should be aiming for. \nAnthony van den Broek Erskineville \nThe reality of the problem of wages in hospitality is not whether employees receive penalty rates – it's whether they're even paid the minimum wage. A young adult friend of mine was told he would be paid $10 an hour, \"take it or leave it\". And this was for kitchen work done day or night, weekends and public holidays. \nThese young people don't think the unions will do anything for them. Is it too much to expect the relevant labour department to crack down on these rogue employers? My friend's experience was the rule, rather than the exception, in a regional tourist area where there is little other employment for young people. \nRandi Svensen Wyong Sometimes, acceleration is the way to safety \nIt was interesting to read that those who attempt to control our actions are now proposing to have our cars make decisions for us if we are speeding (\" Technology could take control when motorists break the law \", October 4). \nThere are a few scenarios that would cause problems, one being what if you need to accelerate to get out of a situation only to find that you suddenly have no control over the accelerator, or, if the weather conditions don't really allow you to drive at the limit but because your digital master says it's ok then you stick to the posted limit and have an accident; not speed related but purely skill and awareness rated, which I would hazard guess is a major cause of prangs. \nWhere I live the street is a 50km/h zone, regularly we get drivers using the road as a speedway travelling well over the limit. Complaints have been made to the local council and the highway patrol but there has been no response. There is a parallel road which has a 60km/h limit but it regularly gets the mobile speed camera's set-up. I wonder why these speedsters decide to rocket down our street? I think it is obvious. \nIt's not the technology that keeps speed down it is the visibility of the police or speed cameras. Maybe a few ideas should be taken from the police in Britain where they placed \"false\" police vehicles on motorway overpasses and the result was the traffic slowed. Simple, cheap and effective, but I guess people here in power always look for the expensive technical option which is sold to them as being the only way to go. \nBruce Webb Umina Beach Anxiety levels of concern to all \nProfessor McGorry is asking Malcolm Turnbull to abandon the plebiscite because of the risk of self-harm and suicide in the gay community (\" Health leader warns of suicide danger with same-sex plebiscite \", October 4). \nHomosexuals are not the only ones in our community who could attempt suicide or whose anxiety levels are of concern to their families or the medical profession. Students facing exams, those experiencing financial disaster and bankruptcy, the unemployed, couples involved in marriage breakdown, the emotionally and sexually abused and the list goes on. \nGovernments and people with authority make hard decisions every day (some overnight) which can affect the anxiety levels of us all or lead to self-harm by some. But should that be the reason to abandon many projects, examinations or as Professor McGorry is requesting of Malcolm Turnbull – the same-sex marriage plebiscite? \nNan Howard Camden \nEven though I do not know Joel Meares, nor am I ever likely to, I would like to congratulate him and his husband on their marriage(s) and wish them many years of conjugal happiness (\" My marriage is still stuck in limbo \", October 4). It's sad that they need to fret about the \"political cowardice and chicanery, buck passing and prevarication\" so prevalent in Australia today. \nDonna Wiemann Balmain \nSlightly over 50 per cent voted no in the Colombian plebiscite (\" Peace agreement voted down \", October 4). Political analysts warn this could be the start of a global trend - that the people will now say no to most questions of government through plebiscite. Let the Colombian experience be a compelling lesson for us all. \nPeter Bower Naremburn Education outcomes \nChris Standen's hope of a 'fair go' for all students by being educated in a single public education system ignores the fact that no two schools have equal outcomes – and this is not simply a matter of funding (Letters, October 4). The key determinants are family educational background, student ability and teacher ability none of which are equally distributed across the population. That parents seek the best outcome for their children by choosing between schools is hardly surprising and would occur regardless of a uniform educational system or not. \nJohn Edwards Ryde Pyne's adviser must pay price \nThe arrest of four not so young Australians in Malaysia has brought shame on our country (\" Pyne staffer among men arrested in Malaysia after stripping \", smh.com.au, October 4). The inclusion of Christopher Pyne's policy adviser Jack Walker, makes things worse. We should also ask whether political staffers are covered by the same rules as public servants who have very strict rules on misdemeanours. Malcolm Turnbull must insist on Walker's dismissal. \nTony Simons Balmain \nGreat to see the government is getting policy advice from mature, professional sources. \nTodd Hillsley Homebush \nIt certainly wasn't a good look for nine Australian revellers at Malaysia's Formula 1 racing circuit stripping down to their underpants/ budgie smugglers which were themed on Malaysia's national flag. They could at least have worn ones with the Aussie flag. \nCarolyn Wills Cremorne \nPerhaps the Malaysian authorities think the nine Australians are literally budgie smugglers and will detain them until they find the budgies. \nLeslie Gonye Carlingford Howard's contribution \nI would argue it is Tom Switzer's defence of John Howard that is beyond a rational understanding (\" John Howard is demonised beyond a rational understanding \", October 4). Misplaced moral conviction is not a quality to be admired, and Howard's support for a disastrous war was not a mistake but a reprehensible, intentional act. \nIf Howard did change the nature of this nation, I suggest it was to reduce our generosity of spirit. Finally, as one of the infamous leaders of the coalition of the willing, he has refused to admit liability even after the scathing Chilcot report. \nGraham Lum North Rock \nTom Switzer, the question of the legality of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was debatable at the time. It was an invasion of a country not for self defence nor following an armed attack by that country. The Secretary-General of the United Nations declared the invasion, which was not sanctioned by the Security Council, illegal. \nThe arguments used to justify the war could equally be used against other nations now, North Korea for example, but action is not taken. \nIt would be interesting to see what \"primary school students\" would make of this, but many would have to disagree with Switzer, and conclude the invasion of Iraq, even using the preventative war claim, was arguably a war crime. \nVanessa Tennent Oatley \nI do not claim to be a friend of John Howard but, having run into him around the law school, at a few parties, watching our respective kids play sport and being separate parts of various audiences, I hope I can call him an acquaintance. \nHe comes across as a good bloke, well aware of everyday life and well attuned to,the \"man in the street\". I would be proud to call him a friend. \nThe venomous attacks on the man so rightly challenged by Tom Switzer should be a source of shame to the thoughtless, bad mannered, ill-informed journalists and rent-a-crowd protesters. \nDavid Scarlett Killara Supporters enjoy all the fun of the circus \nJohn Ward (Letters, October 4) doesn't want Sutherland Shire to become a poor imitation of the Queensland Gold Coast circus following the Sharks' grand final win. \nJudging by the number of \"no vacancy\" signs, the crowded beaches and my coffee shop operator reporting customers queued out to the footpath, it's obvious a lot of people still love coming to the \"circus\". Meanwhile, those of us who have escaped the Sydney rat race (now more a rat crawl) permanently, enjoy our life here. \nCertainly, enjoy your team's deserved win.

Sportscar","text":"Eastwood takes maiden Carrera Cup GB victory, Cammish sets new record 4th October 2016 \nPorsche Carrera Cup GB: Brands Hatch GP, rounds fifteen and sixteen - race reports \nAfter rounds 13 and 14, Dan Cammish (Redline Racing) became only the third driver in Porsche Carrera Cup GB history to secure back-to-back championships. At Brands Hatch after rounds 15 and 16, he became the first ever driver to win 12 races in a season, a win in round 16 a fitting way to end his year and establish a dominant legacy. \nLooking to begin his own chapter in the history of the championship was Charlie Eastwood (Redline Racing), the 2016 Rookie champion tasting the champagne of victory for the first time and underlining a strong debut season. \nThe final championship of the 2016 was won in the last race, fifth in round 16 enough to secure Tautvydas Barstys (Juta Racing) the Pro-Am2 title. \nRound fifteenAfter the difficult conditions in qualifying, Charlie Eastwood converted his hard-earned pole position into a maiden Porsche Carrera Cup GB victory on a dry track. \nLeading away from the rolling start, the Porsche GB 2016/2017 Scholar was shadowed by the returning Daniel Lloyd (IN2 Racing) all the way to the flag, despite an early safety car period bunching up the field. In the end a delighted Eastwood’s winning margin over the 2012/2013 Scholar was just over a second: \n“It’s unbelievable and has been a long time coming. We’ve been chipping away at it all year. We got a good lap in qualifying and controlled it away from the lights. We had Dan Lloyd between us and the pack behind, which gave me some breathing space as well. Going into next year it gives us such a boost to hit the ground running.” \nThe second row was shared by Dan Cammish and Dino Zamparelli (GT Marques), the two season-long rivals battling almost every time into Druids. Zamparelli made a pass for third on the first lap at the hairpin before being repassed by Cammish at the same corner on lap six. The scrap was decided just a few laps later when the 2016 champion made a rare error and spun down to 12th. Zamparelli was able to hold onto his third place despite a late race charge from Tom Oliphant (Team Redline). \nOliphant had made his way through the field to challenge for his second successive podium, making a signature move around Alessandro Latif (GT Marques) which left Latif focusing on his successful defence of fifth from Tom Sharp (IDL Racing) who recovered well to claim sixth. \nAlso recovering well was Cammish, the double champion taking fastest lap by over half a second to finish in eighth. Just five seconds behind was Euan McKay (IN2 Racing), the 2016 Pro-Am1 champion back to his winning ways with an impressive Karl Leonard returning to the championship to split the McKay brothers on the track. \nHowever, as a guest driver Leonard may have taken the champagne, but the second place points went to Dan McKay (IN2 Racing) and those for third to Sean Hudspeth (Parr Motorsport), which left the championship battle for second in Pro-Am1 to be decided in the final round. \nAlso to be decided in the final round was the battle for the Pro-Am2 title. Mark Radcliffe (Intersport Racing) took a strong win to reduce the points gap slightly, but leader Tautvydas Barstys (Juta Racing) emerged in second place with eight points in hand over Peter Kyle-Henney (Parr Motorsport) who fought his way onto the podium and took fastest lap in the process. \nRound sixteenIn a fitting finish to the 2016 season, champion Cammish lined up on pole position with season-long challenger Zamparelli next to him. The two protagonists fell into line astern at the start and even a mid-race safety car period could not prevent Cammish from taking a dominant win to make Porsche Carrera Cup GB history - 12 wins in a single season. \nZamparelli had to make an early defence from Eastwood and Jonas Gelzinis (Juta Racing), the Lithuanian muscling his was past the round 15 winner at Westfields to take third. Behind, Lloyd looked at taking the opportunity to follow Gelzinis through, but with two wheels on the grass slid back into fifth. \nIn a move that was almost a replay, Eastwood went on to take Gelzinis back at Westfields, with Lloyd again thwarted in his bold efforts to capitalise. Oliphant came out ahead in a race-long battle with Sharp for sixth, while Stephen Jelley (Team Parker Racing) managed to slip past the second-placed Rookie Lewis Plato (Team Redline) for seventh. \nIn Pro-Am1, Dan McKay fended off Leonard to take the win with Euan McKay rounding out the podium, the trio separated by less than a second at the flag. The win was enough to secure Dan McKay second in the championship behind his brother, cementing a superb run of form in the second half of the season. \nHudspeth crossed the line in fourth, with John McCullagh (Redline Racing) behind Justin Sherwood (Team Parker Racing) and Peter Jennings (G-Cat Racing) in seventh. \nThe Pro-Am2 championship fight went to the wire, Radcliffe taking another win with Shamus Jennings (G-Cat Racing) in second, just a fraction ahead of Peter Parsons (Car Loan Centre) who took his first podium of 2016 in the final round. \nKyle-Henney passed Barstys for fourth, but could make no further progress which left a delighted Barstys to be crowned 2016 Pro-Am2 champion. \nFinal points standings1.

Brian Purcell, who earlier kicked a penalty, converted the first. \nJack Briggs went over at the end of the half for All Blacks. \nRob Matthews’s try, converted by Purcell, stretched the home side’s lead to 22-5. \nBut Gosford hit back through Dan Bullimore’s score. Tim Ellis added the extras and kicked a penalty. \nHowever, Milton Keynes’ Parkinson crossed again to make it 27-15. \nThe visitors refused to give in and Briggs burst over, Ellis converting. \nBack came the hosts, though, as Richard Hill scrambled over and Purcell added the extras. \nAll Blacks retaliated, with Ben Bodinham crossing, Harry Sutton converting. They pressed for another score, but had to settle for two losing bonus points. \nBicester kept their 100 per cent record in tact by beating Aylesbury 17-10. \nPeter Tarrega went over, with Tom Miles adding the extras. \nThe first half ended 7-0, but Bicester’s Jack Horwood and Aylesbury’s Gary Horne were sin-binned. \nCory Neighbour crossed for the hosts and Stow converted, but a Miles penalty put the visitors 10-7 ahead. \nStow replied with a penalty, but Bicester sealed victory when Dave Hampton raced through. \nMiles converted to make it 17-10. \nHe then missed a late penalty, but it did not matter. \nWallingford recorded a 28-7 victory over Beaconsfield at Hithercroft. \nJames Norris, Sam Botting and James Wiltshire were the south Oxfordshire club’s try-scorers.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"milton keynes","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"peter tarrega","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"purcell","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ellis","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jack briggs","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bicester","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tim ellis","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"james wiltshire","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"gary horne","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"gosford","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"sam botting","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dan bullimore","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lisa horwood","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"briggs","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"rob matthews","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"miles","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"harry sutton","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jack horwood","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"brian purcell","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tom miles","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ben bodinham","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"james norris","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tim parkinson","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"dave hampton","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"cory neighbour","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"richard hill","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"beaconsfield","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bicester","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"gosford all blacks","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"aylesbury picture","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"aylesbury","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"all blacks","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"wallingford","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bicester","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hithercroft","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"oxfordshire","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"aylesbury","sentiment":"none"}]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:57:17.581+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"8da5dffd7fbb27be2b77ccf2fae9215eaa9af0a0","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS8EVq6wnD.uYYZwm6FBQFPB9jiFIbWjA0cSzNFUPqzU.ozuTQfU1.xItDMIvWg6G45KBKf_QcweGiU8DSAHgEHg--","site_full":"www.reddit.com","site":"reddit.com","site_section":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"iOS Gaming","title":"favorite free games","title_full":"favorite free games : iosgaming","published":"2016-10-04T15:11:00.000+03:00","replies_count":2,"participants_count":3,"site_type":"discussions","country":"US","spam_score":0.003,"main_image":"","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":33,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"9ea409524679c7bad1bb916c50bad0e752555abd","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS8EVq6wnD.uYYZwm6FBQFPB9jiFIbWjA0cSzNFUPqzU.ozuTQfU1.xItDMIvWg6G45KBKf_QcweEUBbGk5pToXsZeSOhbAfq9JeQy98HFQa0-","ord_in_thread":2,"author":"iokak","published":"2016-10-04T16:57:19.164+03:00","title":"","text":"/u/Lasero on favorite free games Blades of Brim, HuntCook: Catch and Serve, Happy Sandwich Cafe, Talking Tom?

Quite rare I guess for drummers to have only 12s! I have always assumed they would sound higher and smaller, more for an aux rather than a main snare...\nExactly mate, the printed word\nThis is how it came about. I tried many different snares over the years, more a case of seeing lovely sparkly things and getting GAS as opposed to needing another drum, before settling on my dream snare a Premier Heavy Rock 9. But as a spare just for the hell of it I wanted something totally different. I had the chance of a 12\" Remo Mastertouch but lost my bottle and got a 13\" instead. Everyone in the band said/complained about how loud it was and when the opportunity of the Black Panther Cherry/ Maple arose I went for it as I'd heard that model being talked of in hushed tones. Imperceptibly that snare became my go to one and eventually I sold the Heavy Rock 9, something I never believed I'd do. So then my search was on for another spare and after going bigger I came across the Black Panther Phantom on eBay and bagged that too.\nI'm sure someone can do the sciencey but better than me but the smaller snare seems to inhabit a frequency range all to itself so cuts through brilliantly. I did a gig last night with the drums un mic'd as usual and in a conversation I had during the break a lad from another band commented with a smile that the drums were more than holding their own!\nTo be honest I was sceptical about smaller snares too but I'm now a total convert. It also allows my set up to be slightly more compact and on the occasions that I do find myself with a 14\" snare drum it almost feels like having a floor Tom between my legs, literally in fact because my floor Tom is also a 14\"!","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"crawled":"2016-10-04T16:57:19.208+03:00"},{"thread":{"uuid":"01a780ce151681789f3e67ed7633ba6fb567eba6","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSFSRqO70kkUlzY.YpWU3hQZr1X1xnlzFywHgaRVZ6p.1M8ICP5I.4qlx9JRtB4auKOjjyAMfxSBVdeDfTdouFOzGMq6Gl1qGqMawvdT55bB4-","site_full":"www.reddit.com","site":"reddit.com","site_section":"https://www.reddit.com/r/news/","site_categories":["news"],"section_title":"All news, US and international.","title":"'White Privilege' survey in high school class sparks parents’ ire","title_full":"'White Privilege' survey in high school class sparks parents’ ire : news","published":"2016-10-04T11:17:00.000+03:00","replies_count":175,"participants_count":120,"site_type":"discussions","country":"US","spam_score":0.0,"main_image":"","performance_score":0,"domain_rank":33,"social":{"facebook":{"likes":0,"comments":0,"shares":0},"gplus":{"shares":0},"pinterest":{"shares":0},"linkedin":{"shares":0},"stumbledupon":{"shares":0}}},"uuid":"bb068789aa7b2550ddeb8bbb8a8baaf9d46246ce","url":"http://omgili.com/r/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSFSRqO70kkUlzY.YpWU3hQZr1X1xnlzFywHgaRVZ6p.1M8ICP5I.4qlx9JRtB4auKOjjyAMfxSBVdeDfTdouFOzGMq6Gl1qGqP..HGPzuISnuOApsWeaPt769.SWe3J3t","ord_in_thread":154,"author":"dyingrepublic","published":"2016-10-04T16:57:29.819+03:00","title":"","text":"/u/SedQuisCustodiet on 'White Privilege' survey in high school class sparks parents’ ire How is there NOT equality?

Fortec teammate Pietro Fittipaldi came home in ninth and 12th respectively.It was the turn of the young Brazilian to shine on Saturday morning when he achieved his highest qualifying position of the season. Fittipaldi took the chequered flag in second place with an impressive lap time of 1:33.723, just 0.077 second off pole. Delétraz put the Fortec pairing firmly in the top five by setting the fourth fastest lap of the session.Race one in the afternoon was full of drama for the Daventry based squad. As the lights went out Fittipaldi took the race lead, however he locked up and ran wide at turn one, returning to the track in P5. With Delétraz now running up in P3 the battle for second place was firmly on. On lap five he passed Matthieu Vaxiviere (SMP Racing) at the first chicane to slip in to second position and began a blistering charge. With the battle for the lead too evenly matched Delétraz took the chequered flag in P2, closing the gap to the Championship lead to only 22 points overnight.When running wide on the opening lap Fittipaldi took a kerb and got a cone lodged under his chassis. Undeterred and continuing to push, the Brazilian (and the cone) crossed the finish line at the end of race one in eleventh position.With thoughts of the Championship title firmly in their minds, the Fortec Motorsports team produced a sterling qualifying effort once again on Sunday morning. Fittipaldi set the quickest Rookie lap of the day in sixth place overall with Delétraz ending the session in P8.The weekend finale in the afternoon featured a series of position changing events in quick succession starting with pole-sitter Roy Nissany (Lotus) stalling on the formation lap grid. With the leader heading to the pit-lane, the rest of the pack proceeded to the start and in the opening laps jostling and contact between front runners meant that positions were quickly lost and gained. The race was soon neutralized, however, for a multi-car contact in the mid-field and the action resumed on lap seven.Delétraz pitted on lap nine with the team calling Fittipaldi in for his mandatory stop on lap 10. In a great call by the team, Fittpaldi was able to jump Tom Dillmann (AVF) in the pit stop which enabled him to then make a bold move on Yu Kanamaru (Teo Martin Motorsport) around the outside of turn one. At the end of the 22-laps contest Delétraz took the chequered flag in third and top Rookie podium positions. His fellow Rookie teammate claimed the points haul for a fantastic P4 finish to round off a superb weekend for the young Brazilian.The next stop for Formula V8 3.5 series will be on 29-30 October 2016 at the Circuito de Jerez, Spain. Delétraz heads to the penultimate round of the 2016 season with 182 points on the Drivers’ Championship table just behind Tom Dillmann on 193.Louis Delétraz, #1 Fortec Motorsports“It was a very good weekend. We put a lot of points in the bag; from 40 to only 11 behind Dillmann. To get a double podium and double Rookie wins the entire team did a really good job and executed a great strategy. Now let’s go for the title in the last two race weekends!”Pietro Fittipaldi, #2 Fortec Motorsports“It was a really good weekend in Monza. We qualified in second for the first race, so started on the front row and made a really good start. I made it up to first at turn one, but the brakes were a little cold and I out braked myself a bit and locked up, damaging my front right tyre and basically costing us a potential win.“We had to reset going in to day two on Sunday. We qualified in sixth in damp conditions, so it was a bit of a gamble for everyone on what tyres and wings to use. We started the race in sixth, made it up to fifth, then the team had a really good a pitstop where we gained a position and got to fourth. I was then able to put pressure on my teammate in third and we fought for the podium, but in the end I just didn’t have that little bit I needed to get by him. We will take that fourth though and carry the momentum on to Jerez at the end of October.”Jamie Dye, team manager, Fortec Motorsports Formula V8 3.5 team“It is a good feeling to get both cars upfront and it was a great team effort.
